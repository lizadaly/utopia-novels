# ArQtiQ
## By Anna Adolph
### Published (1899)

  This puzzling novel, self-published in 1899, has an idiosyncratic,
  even ungrammatical writing style, but is deeply lyrical. A
  [biography](https://lizadaly.com/pages/arqtiq/) of the author (who
  stylized the novel as 'ArQtiQ' in her personal correspondance) has
  uncovered the many links between the novel and her life story.
