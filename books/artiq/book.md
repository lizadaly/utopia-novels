### A Story of the Marvels at the North Pole


> Saying ”I will go with thee \
> To yon isles of mystery.” 

Always fond of the marvelous, I conceived a strong 
desire to go to the North Pole. 

To obviate the dangers of the trip I invented a 
coach, that was also ship and balloon. Its silken canopy 
is inflatable to strong wings or wide sails. Its wheels 
are wide rimmed, to glide over snow, and paneled for 
water paddles. When it is finished and stored I select 
some friends to accompany me. My most personal loved 
ones. A volatile fair-haired gent— my husband, and a 
fair-haired little maiden friend, sit on the front seat. On 
the back seat are sitting my aged father and myself, our 
black eyes snapping with expectation. 

Waving my hands to the few gathered to see us off, I 
say: x his undertaking is of desire to gain knowledge, 

Success, surmounting all obstacles will take us to the 
summit of the round earth, where, ages past as ages 
future will accord us first record.” 

Charley turns levers to start, as little Mae’s mamma 
says : “You will be the Mascot, Mae Searles. But I do 
not think you will go very far,” dubiously, 

' You will change your mind, mamma, when I 
bring you home a little bear,” makes us laugh. 

“ 1 will be glad to get you for my little bear.” 

“All the rest of us,” I answered, “ will take car^ 
of her.” 

”No doubt,” she replies, “ as far as you go in your 
odd rig,” facetiously. 

Our wheels turn slowly and silently. Then with a 
low tinkling of the strain, “Good Bye, Sweet Heart.”

Mae had slipped her music box in one, wound to that 
harmony. 

We are Californians and take the C. P. railroad for 
our eastward route, our wheels being grooved to fit the 
track. Speeding merrily, we give vent to our imagina- 
tions of coming events. 

“ Will there really be a pole, Auntie ?*' 

“That is for us to find out, dear. I sometimes 
think there is a stem there covered with ice, that holds 
the earth to an apple planet tree.” 

“ But the astronomers would have seen the tree.” 
argues my father. 

“ They could not look so far. Only as far as the 
other star apples. May not the Milky Way be a 
branch ?” I suggest. 

We now become aware that a train is approaching 
on the single track that is hanging over the grade on the 
canyon side. We have no choice but to unfurl our 
■wings and rise in the air, as the engineer wildly blows 
his whistle. Brushing the pine tree tops, we cross over 
the peak and seek the track on the other side of it, se- 
lecting an opening in a thicket for that purpose. 

Finding it occupied by miners digging away, we 
hallo, when they look every way but up, as we land in 
their midst as though dropped from the sky. Their con- 
sternation is depicted in set jaws, as we give military 
salute and roll off. 

This feat, so skilfully accomplished, denotes an ex- 
pert hand in our motorman, who had been practicing 
faithfully, as a bird to fly, a swimmer or cyclist. As 
exhilarant to him as to us, and much lessened our dis- 
tance, causes Mae to clap her hands and ask, “ Why not 
fly all the time ?” 

We want to save that force until we have more 
serious need,” Charley replies. “I hope that poor boy 
who fell over the log while eating his breakfast and ran 
away, will recover and go back,” makes us all laugh 
uproariously, when zipp ! whir-r 1 ! over we go and lay 
on our side, the wheels still revolving. 

The grade just here, level from the ground excavated 
by the miners, saved us from a serious mishap. To have

rolled to the Canyon River would have damaged us 
greatly. As it is we cannot recover the track without 
that descent. So we twist our car upright (we are 
fastened in our seats) } square it to the hill and down 
we go, losing our breath as we plump splashing into the 
water. 

Our bonny wheels take paddle stroke and carry us, 
laughing over, and up the opposite bank to the track 
there, in its sinuous course. 

“We laughed too quick,” says father. “That 
friend at whom we laughed dropped that fork on the rail. 

I see him behind that boulder.” 

We leave the narrow-gauge track at its terminus 
without stopping, and have no other special accident in 
this vicinity. 

The sun has chased frost and rose hues the higher 
snow peaks. Sierra Nevada (snowy) in its most interesting 
locality is around. Having come on the narrow-gauge 
railroad that connects tries two hugest and oldest of the 
mining cities with the broad-gauge of the Central Pacific, 
we are rounding out on the latter over the famous Cape 
Horn. Spring is in her first freshness. We sniff its 
fragrance, as we shall continue to do, following its 
pioneer march until our arrival at our destination to 
enjoy our summer at the pole, where it is most ernoy- 
able and the only tolerable season. From anoarently 
bare ground are flying the cyclamen banners of the 
Johnny-jump-up. The blue sage (sun dial) cri Yes p j ake 
of national colors, interspersed with the scarlet of the 
gorgeous fireweed, whose leaves and blossoms glow 
alike. Mae gleefully reaches to a dogwood lily (artist’s 
favorite) then snatches a tuft of pink primrose that 
covers a bank and decorates its edge, while I cook the 
breakfast upon our steam heater. It is so late I make it 
serve for dinner also. Putting omelette and ripe straw- 
berries beside the spinach and wild duck. As I finish

green leaves adorning the winter, with red stems of eter- 
nal beauty, is covered with pink waxen sprays, as fra- 
grant, as it is like, the lily of the valley, A momentary 
regret comes to leave in California this worshipped 
shrub. Its blossoms develop to little green-apple fruit, 
the size of peas, of edible flavor. Manzanita is the 
Indian name for little apple. 

Charley appreciates my feelings as he calls out, 
“ Take a last look,” when father, to turn the tide, passes 
the muffins. Our glance down the mountain side falls 
upon a ranch, tiny in the depths ; a maid of midget size 
throws invisible corn to mice-size chickens that flock 
around ; Charley hurls deftly a cracker toward them that 
falls far short upon the mountain side. My spirits rise. 
To be here sings a grateful prnan in my breast. To 
write it is not half the story. 

I remember lovingly the sister cities left behind. 
Mining born and golden reared, with their Californian 
continual lawns, social halls and grand hotels for the 
floating population, this last much improved by the 
efforts of the Salvation Army, who have charmed the 
crowed to good behavior as they enjoy appreciatively 
their sweet-voiced pleadings, 

I look out at the country, dotted with quartz-mill 
chimneys, with their heavy roar, as the heavy stamp 
crushes the granite to free the gold imprisoned in their 
bastile. To all we bid good-bye, as we turn Cape Horn, 
and though still among the clouds, we see and "hear the 
rushing river below. As all streams here are given to 
chatty hilarity, I think once more of the one where oft I 
have walked on trailed path. 

I muse on until in time we salute the desert plain, 
with its sage brush and dog cities. Stations are not 
hailed by us (as in time a small crowd awaits us). Si- 
lently we appear ; like a shadow disappear. 

Our seats are so constructed that we can stand and 
exercise, rock or lie down at ease. Partaking our meals 
without alighting, we have no occasion to lose time. 
Our casing open, banners .flying. I have brought hand- 
work and books. Father is carving on some queer rotary 
wheel that gives three separate motions. Charley and

Mae, on the seat in front, amuse each other and call us 
to the special sights. 

Chicago! We leisurely arrive and traverse silently, 
street after street, sadly impressed that the continuous 
magnificence in equality of buildings, found nowhere 
else, was dearly bought. 

Citizens are crowding our path; obstructing our 
progress by their progressive ardor, for some one has 
telegraphed them of our intended exploration ; to our 
unexpected aspirations, unheeding our desires, they 
hurrah lustily for our success. 

Thanking them, we start on, grateful in our hearts 
for their sympathy. We do not stop in any other city, 
even passing over the suspension bridge quite silently, 
though lost in ecstasy at its cataract view. 

Evading detention in New York, we whirl over the 
Brooklyn Bridge without minding the many curious 
gazers. 

Arriving at Coney Island beach, though a storm is 
coming on, we light our interior and in the dusk are 
about to drop into the sea. A shout goes up outside 
and strong hands hold us. Near us is a carriage whose 
horses we had frightened. In it is an aged man of mar- 
tial bearing, who recognizes my father. 

“Oh, it is you, is it, meandering at night like a 
firebug. Turn around now and go home with me,” he 
said, cordially. 

“ Haven’t time ; we are bound to the North Pole.” 
Hurrying up so quickly, we break away and sink be- 
neath the toppling waves. 

Pelted and tossed all night we welcome daylight ; 
but flash, crack, roar, we draw ourselves closer together, 
and sink in the depths beneath the turmoil, to find other 
disturbance. A massed army of swordfish hold battle- 
front with glowing eyes to an opposing array of giant 
whales, who ponderously coming, lash the sea into a 
vortex. 

The two columns colliding, the first leap in white 
streaks, curl, and land on the latter’s backs, dip and dye 
their swords. The whales shake them off and beat them 
to death in myriads, to be followed by myriads more,

until the sea is red, when suddenly the cavalry swords 
fly, disappearing in the distance. 

I he victorious artillery, the whales, blow them- 
selves, weariedly. We go closer to them — too close— as 
they are a warrior band. A big general opens his 
mouth towards us, disconcerting to our stomachs ; we 
ea a ia,sty retreat to a safe distance, where we watch

— Ccisimir. 

The first iceberg is but the precursor of many that 
block our way. Then block the land to perpetual im- 
prisonment. Giving us first taste of this specialty of 
our trip. As we stop a few days in the last place of 
civilization. 

We find good entertainment with pleasant people 
who are willing to aid us in our endeavor for knowledge, 
yet solemnly warn us not to dare the dangers ahead. 
They stock us with dried meat ; supply us with double 
sealskin outfits ; in fact, sealskins line our sleigh to aid 
in keeping us warm. They end by giving us their utter- 
most paths. 

Had our home friends in California been more 
solicitous, and amused themselves less at our expense, 
at this juncture we would have returned to them, for our 
hearts are dropping like lead. But our pride aids us, as 
our eyes bravely scan the pole star ahead. 

“ Mae, do you want to go home ?” as I see her wipe 
the tears out of her big blue eyes. 

“ Not I ; this is the best part of it. Only the frosty 
air makes me cry.” 

“ No you not want to see your mamma?” 

“ Yes, but I will have so much more to tell her,” 
waking to enthusiasm and paramount faith. 

Polished ice-glass in hand I firmly wave adieu. 

In the last few days of our stay have been finished 
preparations for what, to the nation, is a centennial 
celebration. A barbecue is held on an ice glittering 
plaza. Emerald ice tables, chamois-clothed, hold a won- 
drous feast. Whole reindeer rigs, the sledge a pastry ; 
great Christmas trees are confections. This now engages 
the crowds. 

We rub our hands together, and, shall I say it, our

noses, in local fashion of “good bye,” as our prow 
points north. 

We have carefully selected this season of the year, 
with intent to follow the continual dawn light— -night 
and day — of this region, which yet faint, is hardly suffi- 
cient to keep us moving swiftly, when, lo, near us darts 
up a bright glare, followed by others, around and ahead, 
as far as we can see, illumining the air. They are bon- 
fires of the celebration. Heaps of cones, added to 
yearly, surround a ring of pine trees, the center a tall, 
hollow trunk as chimney. The gorgeous flickering of 
glory, I feel to believe, is miles in extent. 

Climbing miles up the heavy atmosphere, it is ad- 
vanced to iceberg peaks, beyond and below the horizon. 
Visited thus only for ages, do they inclose the pole ? 
Are they the goal we seek ? Springing up the crystal 
shafts in warmth of welcome are reflected back again 
and beckon us on. 

Our minds in sublime mood, to silence, are dis- 
turbed, as father suddenly jerks up his head. “ It is 
the red fire of the north.” The rare mystery the super- 
stitious ancients believed to be a sign of war is now 
solved, and the simple in fact is most beautiful of sight. 

Our path is strangely smooth, as though some hither- 
to sea had congealed and left a frozen plain, which gives us 
grateful relief until our direction ceases and the last 
marked path stops, and an icy lobe rears high before us. 

Clamp-spurring our wheels we climb its height, to 
find a table formation, level graded, an unmistakable 
sign of ice-locked land, as if an island included in the 
cold grasp that holds the sea. We do not go far, when 
a pile of ice rocks hem in a space. We proceed to in- 
spect, Hastily curving by, we are suddenly brushed by 
a bush, and berries rattle lusciously on our window-pane. 
Flinging it open a balmy air salutes us, forcing us out 
upon a bright-hued snow-flower carpet. 

“ What, berries in spring ! in Arctic forcing-houses ! 
no cold night to delay matters!” as Charley is about to 
cram his mouth. But I, on closely examining, fail to 
identify them, and jot in my book a new name, “Oni-

gogies.” He looks over to read. “Gogies, gogies, 
gorge us, please. ” 

“Tu wlm a whu,” wavers our brains and quivers 
our eyes, as we see a great white owl perched on our 
banner, blinking. I see near by an apple vine. I reach 
out and take a most beautiful red specimen, before I 
am aware that it is already in the mouth of a serpent, 
coiled around the twig. Unconsciously an Eve, as un- 
conscious, also, is the reptile, who looks at me with 
kind, appreciative eyes. But I drop the apple and get 
into the sleigh, quite weak, unable to prevent Mae from 
taking and eating another, giving one to father. Seeing 
me in, Charley gets ready to enter, by loading the bot- 
tom. The owl has gone, but approaching is a gorgeous 
stork of orange plumage. Of camel size, it coolly steps 
over us, as the rest quickly step in and we move forward. 

Thinking this may be a lost Eden, I look curiously 
to discover the life tree, to see Mae and father, who have 
turned deathly pale, reel in their seats. Stopping 
quickly, we put snow on their heads and bind it by leaves 
of a high shrub we are under. Shuddering, they grasp 
the leaves in their teeth and swallow the juice as their 
breath revives. A red glow on their cheeks. Was it the 
leaves of healing ? Much trampled beneath had given 
us roadway. As expected, we enter a herd of foxes, who 
are barking in play and basking in the unusual light ; as 
all else, unnoticing 11s, we glide along quite securely/ 

Charley has studied the lesson of the apple, as he 
audaciously reaches down and takes one, and calmly eats 
it in conjunction with the leaves, to my perturbed 
attention. 

We reach the edge of the island and go down to the 
sea plain again, which is here more rough in icy waves, 
making the travel quite difficult. The waves grew 
larger until mountains high, then lessen and gradually 
disappear, having unfolded to 11s a frozen storm at sea. 

The surface is smoother and smoother ; so that we 
start up swiftly. A gale scurries toward us from behind. 
As it strikes us Charley opens valves and we all rise in 
our seats, unable to contain our ardor, as miles are cov- 
ered in our exceeding speed, which continues as the 


12 


ARQTIQ 


moments and hours pass, father's speed-measure marking 
a mile a second. Hundreds of miles are covered and the 
ice is still smooth. Knowing we are not so far away 
from the peaks that point the pole. We hourly antici- 
pate a view as of masts arising at sea, but instead, we 
are shocked to see the flame-hued sk v settle densely in a 
fog. So long our friend, its warmth had melted the con- 
gealed air and now clouds our nautical bearings. Our 
compass is our sole northly guide. But what — what is 
the matter with it that it hangs its head and stops ? We 
are lost! 

In frenzy, now, the hours go by as we circle blindly, 
when a luminant point attracts us far away. Is it the 
serried guide shaft ? It is. 

Famished and cold — our steam spent and wheels 
broken— we make but slow speed toward the flickering 
gleam. Attaining it, we have only left us our wings, 
by which we rise up the cliff side of the topping pinnacle 
— to see others, massed in braided and arcaded confusion 
before us. Weakening, while above their splintering 
and crashing avalanches, we drop on the side of the 
sheerest bayonet of all, as hundreds of hues are changing 
and ranging in glistening sea waves iii a deep, long val- 
ley below us. Not long, but a round level plain, girdled 
by this ring of bergs that hem it in. 

Our pained eyes watch father stolidly take our local 
bearings, then with him shout in audible voice : “ The 
North Pole !” 


“ Lead, kindly, light ! 

Lead thou me on.” 

The north star in the heavens, shining faintly 
through the half-clear atmosphere, has decided ns on 
our locality at the dearly attained goal, costing us 
friends, and country, and possibly our lives. 

The sound of our voices falls dead around and echoes 
into the deep valley below. No sign of the beautiful 
city we had fancifully pictured. Thankful to die in the 
light, with the stars to take our last breath, is only 
left us. 

Mae complainingly whimpers : “There isn’t a pole 
at all!” 

“ Nor open sea,” growls Charley, hoarsely. 

“ The width of the valley determines the flattening 
of the earth, though,” sighs father. 

Fall dead around, did I say ? our voice — I level the 
glass down the berg side beneath me. I see at the 
sound a snowy mass turn about, with a human face up- 
lifted toward me. 

So great the size and wondrous fair the countenance 
I believed myself deceived, as it quickly turns back. 
But I see two hands clasp together in signal. Then low 
organ notes swell from below, which, when loudest 
grown, suddenly stop. 

When the sun in hailing gleam lights a tall spire, 
supporting a ring of gold points arising from the valley 
center, which I now trace for the first time. Fed to 
examine the valley around it, I see shapes of domes and 
wall-signs of a buried city. What are they doing ? 
Whirling and shaking? Presto! the snow canvas rolls 
off, unvailing a full-fledged and much-alive city to my 
amazed mind. From last extreme of despair my hopes 
suddenly arise to so sudden height ! I fall forward and 
cover my eyes, to keep my brain intact. The city at 
last. City of Zion ! Sung of poets and portrayed of

artists inspired of its contour and elysian beauty. Hope 
raises a hosanna in ray breast that is chorused around 
me, where I now give ray attention. 

The human presence below, with feather-plume 
robes, so like snow, swaying back, is hastening up in 
giant strides, anxious expectation on his face. As he 
reaches the ledge on which we lodge the choral voices 
around disclose a throng of people similar to him lining 
all the mountain sides. Their paean of praise to their 
city’s prowess ended, with shouts and conversation they 
prepare to descend. Nearly running over us, babes to 
them in size, they at last spy us, as the first kneels in 
adoration, his hands over us in protection and token of 
possession. 


With tender emotion he essays to quiet our alarm, 
managing at last to emit words that sounded like “ Wel- 
come, Unions!” For a moment I wonder if other 
Americans are here lost before us. Then we bow low in 
reply. Assured of our trust in him he takes charge and 
lilts us from our ruined vehicle to another, standing near, 
wduch is no less than a great white albatross, one of 
many now being mounted by the throng. Robes are 
drawn about us, after we are presented to a lady, also in 
his charge, who, with less success, attempts the words 
he first used. Feeling quite among friends, as he lifts a 
feather- tufted guiding wand resting on the bird’s head, 

I tUiii to the lady by my side, whose first glance, as 
though in bitterness, before our arrival, has changed to 
liveliest sociability in gestures, nods and smiles upon 
Mae, who is cuddled in her lap, 

W ith womamy curiosity I essay to learn the city's 
name, . Understanding my desire she essayed to reply, 
in cordial, harmonious tones, “Arc,” Farther inquiry 
m my. eyes, I get the farther delineation, “It circles 
Aurora, meaning, no doubt, the electric centre. Con- 
tent with this, I scan the dimensions growing, as we 

approach, and ride high above, the snowy pinions of the 
bird throng clouding the air. 

Courts are numerous, covered with great glass 
omes and domes rolled back. As we turn down to one 


ARQTIQ. 15 

of these I hear father whisper to our host, “ How do you 
know English ?” 

With effort he kindly gives the following: “ My 
father, when younger, explored a great deal upon the 
iceberg sea around. Venturing too far one day, he be- 
came lost in an island garden, to find camped there a 
people like you, who fed and cared for him.” How 
simple; his kindness is in gratitude, 

“But where are the people ?” father farther in- 
quired, 

“I do not know. He became lost again from them 
to find his own city. 

Alighting, we are led through conservatory halls to 
an apartment like hall. Of great magnificence, it is yet 
quite homelike, with great cushions strewn about that 
are seats for the great people but beds in size for us. I 
fall on one and am soon fast asleep. Awaking partially, 
a melody is soothing my senses. Sitting up, I see a 
fountain whence issues the sounds. In it I bathe face 
and hands, when the water, acting medicinal, I feel re- 
vived and buoyant, also quite hungry. Father and 
Charley are talking, the latter ending with “ It 
suits me.” 

Mae, still asleep, talks spasmodically. “ Oh, 
auntie! Oh, mamma !” At the last a pain enters my 
heart, never more to leave. Opening her eyes, she 
slowly takes in the situation. Seeing the pain in my 
face, she throws her arms about my neck and says, 
gently, “ No matter, auntie ; it is a sweet place here, 
anyway.” 

The rest now giving way to hunger, as our hosts 
duly regard us with infantile solicitude, I put my hand 
in my mouth, as in the latter’s fashion. Immediately 
wheels of itself into the room a table laden with food. 
Staring at its wizard-like action, we are seated to it. 
No dish, knife or fork, or board. Probably not in the 
land. An enameled lily leaf. The food, light and solid, 
piled in little fruit cups. One is put in each our mouths, 
cup and all. I taste and find it palatable. Our appe- 
tites satisfied, out wheels the table, making Mae smile 
and become merrry. Seeing us still high perched, our

jolly friends rally around us,, pull our toes and pinch our 
cheeks, until I wish I had refrained in initiating this 
program. Soon in comes a hassock and wheeling to us, 
gives us an opportunity to alight. Mae down last, re- 
mains seated on it, when it starts around the room with 
—her, pirouetting in mazy figures, giving its occupant 
mazy face. 

When stopped, the host whistles, to bring from a 
corner two great white mice, kitten size. As he twirls 
his fingers, they fall to the floor, a green sward ; folding 
their four pink paws to their breasts, they become round 
balls, thus roll about, greatly to our amusement. 

This has suggested to the lady, who proposes to 
“go out in town to an entertainment that is funny, oh, 
so funny.” 

The host, in gleesome impulse, elects to take me. 
Raising me on his hand, he asks my name. Charley, 
quite diverted, gives it, “ Anna.” 

“Ah, you are angel, Anna!” when Charley reads 
the puzzle, remarking, “ He means ‘ English.’ Then he 
kisses me squarely in the mouth, to my immediate 
struggle to get down, which I succeed in doing while he 
is taking Charley in his other hand, who now, unlike 
other husbands, proceeds to lecture me. “ Do not be 
odd ; you see it is all right. It is evening hour in 
America (swallowing) ; we will enjoy this, our first 
evening here.” 

Mae, who has taken to the hand I have left, reaches 
and pinches him ; at which I laugh and spring into a 
pocket in front of the lady, upon whose shoulder sits my 
father, his hand holding her feather cap. So utterly 
without matronly dignity am I, I am glad for once that 
home friends cannot see my position. 

Getting into the center of the street, she stops, (I 
nearly fall) and sits upon a chair, raised from the road- 
bed by the man, who takes another. The object is plain, 
when we move swiftly along as on a track. 

Mae asks ingenuously her bearer’s name ; he gives 
it in Arc language, what sounds to 11s like “ Show OfF, M 
which we shall now call him. Then looking to my 
bearer he says : “ She is Aunt Robot, a dear old maid,

who is always taking care of us, papa and I, when 
mother is away.” He goes over and squeezes her 
shoulders. As father innocently sticks a pin into his 
hand, he looks so queerly at the hurt, it is plain he does 
not know the cause, or never felt the like before. In our 
childish role we still question : “ Where is your papa ? 

“ Oh, he is always in his house (room). You can live 
with him,” looking at my father. Seeing us unwilling at 
such an arrangement, his aunt explains : “ He is a stu- 
dent, a very great savant, who is always busy in his office 
or study.” This alters the matter ; father’s eyes glisten 
with expectation. 

Arrived at the hall I see a great space in the floor, 
that is grooved in pattern. I look to see if a cable line 
is drawing through, when I am deposited on a chair 
directly above. The rest have chairs near by. Mae 
retaining her place in Show Off’s lap. The other chairs 
in the room are being rapidly filled. I cannot determine 
the entertainment so wait developments. Not long. The 
word is given, the chairs start off, getting a swift gait. 

I suddenly remember Mae’s hassock, but she is watching 
Charley, who takes a firm hold, as the important look, 
assumed at our departure, goes slowly off his face, ejac- 
ulating but once “Shake.” I think, too, shake, for 
quiver, jerk, jump, all in rotation ; music playing is the 
order. Enjoying our mutual discomfiture, our chairs 
opposite, we are treated at the last to a grand bounce, 
that sends us into each other’s arms, so close. Had not 
Mae been held firm, she would have fallen, in, her con- 
vulsion of mirth. 

We lose no time in getting down, and close to our 
bearers. Aunt Robet, placid in demeanor, I calculate 
how to get even with her. Though she had declared it 
funny, I look at her viciously, when she condescends to 
graciously explain: “This is our outing celebration; 
the city shakes off its veil to greet the sun ; shaking is, 
therefore, the order of the day.” Hence this little exer- 
cise. I was happy to have amused her. 

We ride now leisurely home, viewing the heavy 
buildings of great blocks of ice, shining in the sunlight,

they are covered with an enamel that preserves them. 
The picturing on their sides is done by fracturing; the 
graceful cornices and other trimmings are in imitation of 
snowflake crystals, relieving to beauty their solidity. 
Quite exhausted on our return, we are given apartments 
to ourselves, in which we prepare to rest. 

Convinced that false positions are unfortunate, I 
resolve to adopt a dignified bearing, suitable to my ma- 
turity, my short experience in babyhood, however 
remunerative, proving quite objectionable in excess of 
bestowment. 

Hearing father sigh, as he watches the dawn that 
beckons to arise instead of sleep, I essay to comfort him. 
“ Dear father, has not God sent us here to convert 
them?” ‘‘Too intelligent,” he mutters; “they will 
convert us.” Science is his religion.

Waking early, my prayer goes up to God, with 
ray whole consciousness borne intact. So when we miss 
a link in our self-calculated program of events, we look 
to Him, the holder of the links of us — his marionettes 
below. 

Charley rushes in with a bundle. I speak : “ Are 
you up, dear, and not sorry that we came?” “ Haven’t 
time. Get up and see your new dress.” I sit up. 
“ Invisible garments,” he explains. I hurry to him to 
find only the usual feathered robes, that in tint and 
style give ail an appearauce of the feathered tribe. 
Tufted cap and sweeping train ; wing sleeves, with 
which, could we fly, we would be the angels we are 
called. 

“ But where is the invisible?” I inquire. 

“ Dressed like everybody else, not visible, because 
not conspicuous,” settles that problem. 

I take the hint and hastily get into the suit assigned 
me, but not as quick as he, for he is dressed, and out, 
and down the hall, while I admire myself in the glitter- 
ing ice-mirror w r alls, vanity for a moment overcoming 
homesickness to forget that such an unhuman-like 
attire, though beautiful in heaven’s songsters, is more 
beautiful, even, in a civilized American. 

In bounds Saucy — that is what we nickname Mae. 
“ Where is my dress ?” 

“ Here.” She is soon in it, her flowing hair making 
her a canary. Bowing to me in mockery, she says : 

" We belong here now. Where is Charley,” looking 
around.

“lam going to catch him.”

“ So am I.” , 

She calls him Charley, because I do, and that he is 

not her uncle ; nor am I her aunt, which she uses in 
lieu of Anna. Running out so hastily we run smack 
into the arms of Show Off, which we immediately see is 
not him, but probably his father, from the likeness who 
grasps us in each hand, holding us out for inspection, 
saving “ I have caught two little birds that have flown 
to me.’’ (Like pigeons, I wish we could fly home again.) 
“ We have no cage here, only freedom ; so now I let you 
go ” suiting the action to the word. Cordial as sedate, 
I watch him as he walks down the hall and disappears. 
In trying to find Charley, we find ourselves in the city 

street , 

11 Mae, dear, to-day is Sunday ; let us find a church, 
as we inspect the various houses. We select a large 
domed enclosure as a temple to God. Stepping to its 
crystal doors it opens itself to us. Within is a rest 
scene. Standing or sitting, all look serene, as sacred 
dreamy notes of melody fill the air, flower perfumed. A 
soothing sense of peace takes possession of us. Instead 
of high aftar, Hebraic, or idol, or Hindoo custom, a lady 
aud gentlemen are passing among the people, speaking 
kind admonitions, solemn adoration, or cheering re- 
sponses. I reflect ; this may be their manner of service. 

The lady passing us, (who I see is our hostess) 
chucks us under the chin playfully, saying, “Sweets, 
have you come to court?” 

“ Court? I thought it was a church,” I explain. 

“ What is a church?” she asks. 

“ Where we pray to God.” 

Oh, we should do that everywhere. The earth is 
His court. This is only an Arc court,” as she passes on. 

I still think it a church. 

“Auntie, some are dancing ; do you see?” I did. 
She tried the step in childish glee. 

Is it a church dance ? A worship mode suitable to 
the Arctic locality. How the Unitarians and Catholics 
would enjoy it. But f — my M. E. founder, Asbury, was 
lame, so could not dance, therefore we preach it down. 
Saucy, as Episcopal, sees no harm.

But now she pulls me out and waltzes me around. 
(I had learned the art before I joined the M. K.’s.) The 
glow of circulation raises my spirit to a desire to shout. 
I do so in M. E. denominational style, solacing ray con- 
science thus far. Soon it pricks again. 

When tired and resting I study out the scripture of 
this new service. Would Jesus (if here) adapt a sermon 
to its beneficial principles, as lie had done to baptism 
(bath) of the crowds drawn to the river side for that 
purpose, obligatory in their sweltering climate ? Are 
not all church rites illustrative of adaptations of the 
one worship— Spirit and Truth ? 

These thoughts adding so much of scriptural inter- 
pretation of new modes, adding, therefore, new program 
to my former stereotyped observances, I become at first 
slightly confused, but reserve my settled decision, until 
have farther and more deeply weighed the subject. 
Until then, I wonder. 

What is best for us to do in such .a church as 

this ?” 

I turn as I speak aloud, to see Charley by my side, 
who has overheard all, and coaches me. “ Do > Make 
the earth a church, as do these people.” The noon hour 

arrived. Refreshments of light and solid food are passed 
to all. 1 


Not having got over the impression of its being a 

church, Mae, who has not heard the explanation turns 
and says : ’ 

“ Auntie, it is a sacrament ! The little gum paste 
cups hold drink. I do not think it will harm me”

and a church in one. I am quite converted and wish 
ours at home would become the same, but Charley, wtio 
is still by my side, impatiently waiting to get my full 
attention, remarks, jokingly : “kittle folks should keep

“ Parlor ? How do you know this is the parlor . l

does make so remarkable blunders in his attempt to 
apply our cultured phrases, I quite despair to get out of 
him by question what I wish to know. I reflect deeply, 
what can their church be ? Can it be in happy unison,

as is this human social church — to wit. parlor ? 

Presently I recollect that here is but one city, one 
people. Allowing one chnrch to be feasible, what about 
different races, who have different forms of devotion 
that to them take the place of religion or its compara- 
tive manifestation, though religion itself is solely an act 
of the heart. 

I imagine present before me this heterogenous 
crowd. A Catholic crosses himself, a Shaker shakes, a 
dervish howls ; Buddhists, Mahometans, and Confucians 
appear, Closing my eyes I wonder, could they not, one 
and all, do their several forms in the same building ? the 
same “ free for all” church in the same “free for all” 
country. Trading and walking together with mutual 
respect, why nut worship also ? 

I look around and see Charley coming back. He 
stops short at my expression. “ What are you now con- 
juring up?” he asks. I told, “a church, where all kinds 
of people worship in one building.” 

“ Very good ; when we go back home we will get 
one up ; call it a church fair, or carnival of churches. 
Each and all sects to have a booth of their own. The 
Hindoos would put up an ox as a symbol. The Mahom- 
etans — what ? a goat. The Jews a sheep. The Chris- 
tians a lamb. The Chinese a roast pig. Egyptians a 
cat. Other pagans, somewhere — a snake. Taken alto- 
gether, an animal fair, and as all have good points, even 
a snake, Americans would accept all, and could, by pro- 
tecting each, make them a happy family. As a cat and 
dog of one family live in peace under one roof, and the 
church symbolic animals in one farmyard, so could the 
principals they symbolize aid in its several good, in one 
church building.” 

I look prayerfully to him and say v > regretfully, “ But 
you don’t believe Jesus is coming back.” . 

“ Yes, I do,” he replies. Then is He coming. For 
this is He waiting. Peace on earth, among the churches. 
Upon the cross Plis arms were spread. To reach around 
the earth, to join all churches in peace, which is brother- 
hood ; children of God — Father.” 

“ What would the Jew say to that ?”

“They started it before Jesus. The Jewish High 
Priest Hillel composed the prayer, ‘Our Father.’ ” 

“Yes ; but he meant it ouly for the Jews.” 

“ Well ! he can still be a Jew, in the new world 
church,” and walked briskly around. 

I muse. Where would be my father’s place, as he 
is an infidel, in this many-sected or membered church. 
Would Jesus enfold him as a neighbor of kind heart ? I 
think so. Entirely rejoicing in this selection of God’s 
following, I charmingly ask Show Off, who now appears, 
“ How long do these churches hold open ?” 

“ Always, with Gods as relief.” 

“ You mean ministers — but does nobody work ?” 

“ Yes ; at the schools until noon.” 

What ! half of time for God, instead of seventh ? 
Can the miilenium have come here? Has, most likely, 
no one told them of the Sabbath ? One day of seven ? 
Well, we can keep both — certainly our Sabbath, and 
explain to these people wdiy we do. 

“ One question more. Have you jails in this city ? 
What do you do to people vicious in hot anger !” 

He turns partly to me to see what I am asking ; 
then, understanding me, he answers gravely : “ Freeze 
them.” 

Aunt Robet, now off duty, takes charge of us, con- 
ducting us to her sitting-room. 

But two days pass, in which we endeavor to learn 
.the Arc language, as none except the three already men- 
tioned can converse with us, when Charley brings forth 
the masque. 

“Oh, yes; but it cannot be a ball nor a domino 
party, I am curious at your idea. If it is beneficial and 
delightful as what I have already seen, I will be pleased 
to participate,” I reply, cautiously to my gentle mate, 
who, devoted to social assembly, and believing ennobling 
dancing as consistent as ennobling singing, he has' no 
patience with my doubts. 

“ What am I to do?” I ask in prayer. Silent a 
gentle whisper breathes in answer, “ It is one o! the ten 
talents ; beware of letting it rust!” One of talents, 
loantd us of God, and not a sin of the world? Or are

the sins of the world perverted use of honorable talents, 
to be redeemed by us by honorable use ? its omission, of 
condemnation. 

Can I burnish and enlarge my consecration to Thee, 
oh God, in gay circle ? Dost Thou truly love, also, 
happy faces? At the hall we don our costumes and are 
shown into a green bower, so banked with trees, shrubs, 
and plants there seems no space for guests. These, I 
soon discover, encostume everywhere about ; I discover, 
also, much relieved, that the object is educational, only 
— to put us in touch with "the least of these” that God 
noteth. 

A huge butterfly lights in front of me, greeting 
me cordially. So like a host I feel quite at home 
as a concourse of bugs, bees, and insects arise 
around, with waving wings, until I think I never 
saw before so moving a sight. A bee hummed in 
my ear — a sound like Charley ; a mosquito sung in glee 
— a note like Saucy ; a wasp with saucy eyes — Show Off. 
Moths in the windows, locusts in shady nooks, and a 
cricket adds its refrain. Sitting upon a scarlet ottoman, 
it moves off on its four feet — a live cochineal. Standing 
under an umbrella tree I was "darned” by a "needle” 
to a branch ; a hopper hopped to a sheaf of wheat ; lady- 
bugs minced ; graybeards stalked around ; a black- 
coated beetle handed me (as a weavil) a rose conserve, 
saying: " A ‘ flour’ for you.” I accepted it, making 
room for him by my side. But soon the hostess, bringing 
to me a "bigbug,” who asked a promenade. Replying 
to him " May bee,” the beetle gets up and snaps spite- 
fully away. 

I could see no harm, as the hours passed swiftly, 
teaching us a social sympathy, with this (insect) realm 
of the Creator, who now, as I apply my mind (talent ?) 
to them, have alw T ays, as us, displayed love to their kind, 
dislike of pain, and gratefulness to benefactors. The 
younger danced in buoyant evidence of youthful being, 
the elder in touch with their delight. I saw no harm, 
and wished that all dancing in America could be so 
eminently cultivating in bodily exercise and polite de- 
meanor.

The rooms are not close. We did not stay late to 

become weary. . , . , 

Returning, I discover I have acquired a home inter- 
est. I see an enclosed balcony greenhouse, that lme 
the fronts of the buildings, filled with ferns and foliage, 
new to me, that the sun is marvelously unfolding. ley 
seem to grow up from the ground that must be far beneath 
the snow, and clinging to the ice-block wall, do not 
wither, for an enamel surface on the walls prevents. I 
then perceive why the late deep snow has spared them, 
snow that has been let below in covered trenches. 
Charley is going to pompously interview me. 

“You are not so dreadfully horrified, I see. There 
are. you see, different grades of parties. At this you 
were intellectually amused and society edified. I wonder 
this people do not drink. I must teach them the thick- 
ening of wine blood,” slightly wavering. 

“Thickening of wine-tongue and brain; how did 
any human being ever adopt it? I earnestly believe it 
was water and not wine that Jesus recommended. (J hat 
has been mistakenly translated.) That being plain 
God’s design.” I speak prophetically. 

“Dear,” he says, “you are right; I will let the 
people here be temperate ; thus, I believe, more enjoy- 
able.” Then coming close to me he says: “I was at 
the party to protect you in safety of ease, you know, so 
give me that due for your unrestrained mirth.” 

He is so autocratic in his manlv assertions I be- 
come slightly overawed, when Show Off, who has had 
no lesson of him to regard his dignity, conies up and 
snaps his ear playfully. The fire darts from his eye, but 
I quickly make peace, using his own words : “ You see, 
it is all right; do not be odd.” 

Thus quickly, everywhere, wrath arises innocently, 
to burn often in high flame — to indite some deed of evil 
intent. 

Seeing Charley still cross, I converse with Show Off 
— ask him where my father is, that T have missed these 
three days. “Has he found your father’s room? and is 
he quite happy ?” 


ARQTIQ.

“Quite. You will never get him again,” meaning 
that I am substituted. 

This talk, though rather un-English in phrase, is so 
intentionally jolly, I become quite familiar, so ask : 
“ Dear Show Off, why did the sweet Aunt Robet never 
get married ?” 

“ She is going to be, when her lover comes down out 
of the sky.” 

This mysterious news sets Charley off into a roar of 
laughter, so I proceed : “ What does he do in the sky ? 
ride about on a star ?” 

“ Yes ; and fishes below with a line for pastime.” 

I look warily each side of me. “ When is he com- 
ing down ?’ ’ 

M When the signs are right. We expected him at 
the Outing ; since then we are unhappy.” 

In this lovable manner does he couple himself with 
his relative’s heart, who now approaches, and his snap 
is repeated upon her glowing cheek. But she, as Char- 
ley, gets cross, and he comes back to me. I suddenly 
miss Saucy, to see her flaxen hair dangling out of his 
sleeve, and know that it is she, in childish fashion, who 
had done the snapping to our disconcertment. 

Laughing at the innocent cause of war I turn aside 
to enter the court, which we are passing. Soucey see- 
ing, drops out of her nest and hugs close to my side ; the 
rest proceed in peace. 

“ Ain’t it nice, Auntie, to have a church to step into 
all the week. You feel so safe to stop in such a place. 
No one expects us to buy something, or read something* 
or talk something. I wonder if they take up a col- 
lection. If not, the tax supports it,” 

“ I do not believe they know what- money is, though 
certainly they do its equivalent— work. We must fiud 
the shops atid select some w 7 ork ourselves.” 

Then, as Saucy mutters to herself, “What a queer 
people; no fire, no dishes, no money, no Sunday no 
schools,” I look around at the delightfully intelligent as 
delightfully happy countenances ; though the majority 
are lying comfortably back in their drapery supports and 
fast asleep. This seems to be the rest hour, and I as

Saucy lays her head in my lap, also to go to dreamland. 
In vision a mighty angel descends from God, down 
through the open dome and takes us by our wing tips, to 
carry us off. Hoping it is to America, I keep my eyes 
closed in expectation, until an unusual jar involuntarily 
opens them, showing the angel to be Show Off, who has 
deposited us safely at home on a cushion by the side of 
Robet. 

Half uncertain, as half awake, I hum to myself the 
tune of “Home, Sweet Home,” when Robet gets down 
by me and swelling her throat, warbles forth, like a bird 
of paradise, an entrancing melody, soothing me again to 
slumbers. 

I awake in high fever ; at least so I am told, weeks 
after, when I sit raised on a cushion and am able to talk. 
“ Yes, Auntie,” says Mae, “ when you were in delirium 
you talked such strange talk. You raised up once and 
asked us ‘ What is in heaven ?’ I humored you and 
said, ‘Golden streets,’ but you shook your head wildly 
and waved your hand, saying, ‘ No, no ; golden ice, the 
sun shines all night to make it,” 

While all regard me, lovingly, a golden point of 
light enters the room, dropping at my feet , causing con- 
sternation in the rest. Show Off hurries out and brings 
a tablet ; reading it they point excitedly to me ; the sun- 
burst growing, they gaze in stupor. 

Not until it lessens and departs do they regain com- 
posure, when I ask, “ What is it?” Robet answering, 

“ A prophecy. This sign that has never been just this 
way before, heralds a new era in Arc ; a new people, a 
new laud. The latter a necessity, as Arc is just evenly 
full.” 

My overbalanced visionary tendency becomes im- 
bued with a new power. I rise in the air, spiritually, 
out of the open dome. Ascend to the high-poised 
golden points, still glowing, (my soul having left mate- 
rial enclosure) in the center, and look down a cavity 
miles wide in extent, whence drops the last golden ray ; 
a black cloud receives it. A glint of silver lining and 
all is opaque.

The new telepathic condition I had suddenly gone 
into does not entirely leave me. But takes a new torm, 
that of outwardly statue or marble state. _ . . 

Seeming cold and rigid to others, I see intuitive y

conscious at times of miraculous ability, as though I 
could put forth my hand, and command omniscent like. 

As Robet tenderly teaches us Arc ways and diver- 
sions, I see the adaptation in foreknowledge, and sur- 
prise her and the rest, so that they are getting an awe of 
me, and are carefully respectful of my person.

“ In the depths ” 

Mae goes out everywhere, often alone, finding the new 
ways and amusements of the city. 

When she finds one she thinks I will enjoy, she hur- 
ries home all out of breath to take me or tell me. 

She has been hunting around the halls to-day, as if 
there were hidden mysteries close by. I do believe she 
has found one. Her hair flying and eyes dancing, I go 
to meet her, to see what it is ; getting some emotion in 
my own frame. “Come in here, Auntie.” In there I go, 
like a lamb. 

It is a glass entry of some sort. (I will stop to ex- 
plain what I call glass, as it is not exactly, but some 
transparency quite serving the purpose.) Mae pulls cer- 
tain knobs and lets in what — water! 

“Auntie, this is bathday. We have on bath rigs. 
Put on this helmet with its tubes above for breathing.” 

I do so, as the water deepens. She opens a gate now, 
and a flood rushes in, and takes us off our feet, which we 
regain by use of our elastic breathing tubes. 

We pass through the gate to all the glories of the sea. 
A sea bath — sea mosses under our feet, shells piled in 
heaps, fern trees waving. 

Mae dashes out and hides from view. I discover her, 
but cannot hold her with my wet hands. 

We hear a song. In the door of a crystal grotto 
stands a mermaid. “ Come into my bower, and I will 
give you amber. I am a sister of seven who combs her 
long hair in the deep.” 

Ascending steps of dainty harpshell, we tread an ane- 
mone carpet where is a crowd of people. 

Games are in order on rock ruby stands, in which I 
become engrossed, as a “sister” plays a cameo-mandolin; 
another singing a rollicking song of the sea, ending in 
sobs, for those who come down in ships. 

There is sea-dancing — liquid symphony, I see Charley

in his native element, precluding tears or weeping for 

joy- 

We round out on a tower top, and board a nautilus 
with unfurled sail. We ride over a gold fish “gilt- 
edged n school , and a bank of red sea berries that holly - 
like call up to us “ Merry Christmas." 

Furling our sail, we drop down into the entry, which 
we empty, and strange, our garments are dry. 

We emerge among our friends. A sweep of robes is 
so close passing me, I look up at the colossal face. It is 
Robet, but a strained, nervous look forbids me to follow. 

Toppling upon the hem of her robe, I am carried per- 
force in her company. She stops in a conservatory, 
where one grand tree is growing, and bends down a 
branch. I look to see it and all the tree transcribed with 
names — a veritable family tree. More distraught, she 
speaks in a loud-pitched voice, down into the face of 
Charley, who has followed me (seeing him not), “ Have 
you a pedigree?" He colors up in wrath, then takes a 
tablet from my chatelaine, and places it in her hand, 
which awakes her. Smiling, she says, “I did not mean 
you." Charley reacting from anger to hilarity, seizes a 
twig, crying, “I will write a pedigree," as a red pollen 
drops, touching up my cheeks. "They need it," he 
says, and goes for Mae, who now comes, and soon she 
glows like an Indian. 

When he is gone, Mae, in order for ablution, opens 
near by a door, that is outwardly a picture. (More 
mystery). 

Can it be the secret sanctum of Savant, that I have so 
vainly hunted ? Father sits in an easy chair deeply en- 
gaged with a pictured script. I look around but 'see no 
books or apparatus— a cheerful, cosy room only. I look 
over father’s shoulder as he turns the papyrus leaf, hold- 
ing over it a microscope. I catch sight of the meaning. 
Giving a sudden cry, he arouses to my presence. He 
takes me on his knee, and we follow together the tiny 
pictured lines of a story. 

Anon a kitten purrs by me; I look up and see the host 
intently reading my expression in his own absorbed, 
telepathic style. Genially smiling, he takes my two

hands, and kneeling places them on his head, thus con- 
fessing his service to my will. Though in my new normal 
state, I feel to deprecate myself, and smile in humblest 
mode, as he rises and sits next us in similar seat. 

Before w’e turn to our occupation, an incandescent glow 
falls upon the page, causing us to raise our eyes quite 
wonderingly. The light emanates quite mysteriously from 
Robet, whom I had not before observed as thus illum- 
ined. I see in her hand a lighted lantern, which she is 
studying, or the shining words upon it. 

That these latter are possibly a code of rules is deter- 
mined by her action. Sinking down at Savant’s feet, 
she asks, “Do give me some new plan for court to-day.” 

“I will give you one,” speaks up father. She turns 
full to him. 

“It is lawyer, a word signifying welfare.” 

I was aware my English language was prolific of 
varied meanings. I am pleased to hear this develop- 
ment. “Law,” he continues, “transposed is ‘well;’ yer 
is “ ‘fare.’ ” 

Miss Robet has caught his idea, and elaborates it. 
“When I go iflto court, the good word shall be welfare; 
when I come out— farewell,” and is gone. 

Dear Robet, what is her secret sorrow, that she hides 
in her tender breast? Her genial soul should have no 
rebuff. Why is her intended away, as I have heard? 

Quite changeable in mood, as is Show Off, her great 
chum, who gets it from his mother, the latter a triplet 
sister with Robet, and now on a visit to the other triplet 
sister. 

We now give attention to the story before us. but so 
loudly sounds a refrain in my ears, “Savant before you 
is the greatest of living men,” until I become impatient, 
and ask, “how great?” “Ask him hidden knowledge,” 
refrains back to me. 

What can it mean? 

I will treat him to some unsettled points in spiritual 
doctrine to test his lore. 


Immortality of the soul is an universal instinct. 

Phil. S chaff, D. D. 

Looking to where he sits, I study one in my mind, 
and observe father sees my abstraction. I can tell by a 
wrinkling around his eyes, he is preparing himself for 
enjoyment of the debate. 

“ What is the breath of life?” I at last ask ingenuously. 

“Oh, I can answer that. I have found it out since I 
have been here. That is an easy question.^ It is, my 
dear, electricity, which we assimilate into spirit. Simple 
in explanation. The electric soul batteries of our organism 
thus supplied by God, the maker of souls, drawn in with 
our breath.” Quite suavely preaches my father to me. 

“Yes, but there are two electricities; how could we 
take both and live?” 

“There are two electricities, assuredly. They assimi- 
late; the assimilation is life.” 

I feel dubious, but see clearer as he proceeds. 

“The earth has negative electricity, the other positive, 
or masculine, comes from the sun, uniting to life.” 

Suddenly I burst out, “That makes the sun our father. 
Pray, who is God, who made the sun?” The eye 
wrinkle deepens. “In that case, our grandfather.” 

I scorn to smile. 

“Does this soul life have bodily sense after death ? ” I 
again venture a second question. 

“Yes, and bodily sustenance in the air, where is body 
material, tho’ invisible.” 

I clasp my hands to my head, and rush out of the 
room. But close behind me is Savant, who is pleased to 
wish more acquaintance. 

I overcome my awe, but do not care to inquire on ab- 
struse subjects. We go out into the street, and traverse 
its length before I am attracted by a special diversion. 
Entering a hall to rest, we are witness, to me, of an utterly, 
and at first inconceivable, exhibit, unheard of before

novelty. It is the paradoxic act of a Concert, or Opera, 
without sound — seen and not heard. Upon the stage are 
rows of lights (reflections) graded in size like the string 
of a harp. Raising and lowering these in varying figure 
by' skilful players constituted the performance. The 
changing (not unison) melodies in grave or gay parts, or 
intermingling, swaying my emotions. I lean back in 
rapture. 

I am studied by my escort, who has been addicted 
thus, since first he looked at me. 

The green sward beneath our feet, as on all floors, 
prevents the unpleasant custom o\ stamping. Soon the 
walls moved in and out, portraying drama. A row of 
graded boys and girls also, carrying dolls in wickers that 
they stood up against the walls, bowed their heads and 
waved their hands in pantomine melody. Marching 
away, the boys carried the dolls. 6 

We were quite diverted, laughed heartily, stamping 
on the sward floor, that produced no sound. 

We will tell Mae about this,” I remarked. “.Let’s 
go home and send her here.”

We are tired before they. “ Do tell us some more,” 
they ask. 

The next day they are still curious, and keep us 
engaged in exhibit. , 

We advert to our railroads, telephones, etc., to their 
confusion, as we have no samples. Catching in their 
perplexity some similarity to their own achievements, 
they bring forward and strive to teach us how they move 
articles by a solution. Chairs and street cars in 
their wizard propulsion are solved. 

“Is it a vegetable or mineral? ” 

‘‘It is animal.” 

Their explanation as greatly confounded us. 

‘‘We get it from a fish, which Savant found when he 
was last over the ice. He saw the ice strangely cracking 
to find the queer fish. Grasping it, there was an explos- 
ion of sound. He brought some home, but they are 
hard to raise.” Finding us continue in solicitude to 
understand, they treat us in exchange of our revelations. 
Our story reminds them of one to match it. 

One day explaining to Robet how Unit ladies make 
themselves young-looking by cosmetics and pencils, she 
says briskly, ‘‘I will take you to-morrow where they 
make themselves old and wise-looking. You will be 
pleased ; it is a fine city.” 

After dinner we go. Arriving, I see the houses are 
crackled in straight or curved lines of beautiful design. 
Lines are the fashion. 

The costume was striped in pattern. The sward car- 
pet was stems in graceful arrangement. 

The table for light refreshments was a single piece, 
curving in rings from top-yase to cake and lower fruit- 
trays dowm to numberless seats, all curls of its octopus 
dimensions. 

As Robet said, the special fad in face garniture of the 
ladies, as well as the gents, was aged penciling in lines. 
The marks of wisdom sit quaintly on young brows. 
Drooping mouths are traced to upward curve. Sad eyes 
smile ; laughing are deepened in thought. 

The ribbon-dressed babies are ribboned into similar 
hammocks, to be swung back and forth.

Their mode of worship at court was to stand in 
straight lines, like soldiers of God. 

Their games are sticks (kindergarten) which they also 
work into ingenious devises of cabinets and stands. 
The arches of apartments decorated thus. 

Their adieu was straightening of the fingers. 

When on our way home, I kiss Robet. My statue 
sense is wearing away. Still yet, I seem to see the past 
and future. Interior of minds. An aura-cathode light 
clarifys. I ask; to answer; my own questions. 

“Are spirits before birth individuals?” 

“No, only in bulk, combining chemically at birth.” 

“Dangers in this life, are there dangers in the next?” 

“There are.” I listen to myself statue like.” 

At last I ask Savant, “What is it?” He is puzzled as 
I, and questions me on my church faith. I tell him 
about Adam and Jesus; the latter to tell us all mysteries, 
when he comes in the clouds. He is intensely interested. 

I get my bible and read to him day after day. 

Much affected one day, he looks up to ask : “May not 
he the God have sent this upon you to make you his 
second forerunner?” 

Is the secret solved? Am I the herald-searchlight to 
to His path ? 

(And is he— the Savant— my mission aid)? Near by 
me, concealed by art-screen, I hear a sob, and see a yel- 
low gleam of hair drop on a loving shoulder. Saucy 
sobs up to a face, thinking deeply. “Cholly,” coaxing, 
“what shall we do— will she go up into the sky?” 

A jerk of the shoulder straightens up the head, and 
sobers the grotesque grief of its face. “No, you do not 
know her. She is smart, I allow, but not so ^mart as 
she thinks.” (I feel so funny as I listen). “She is weak 
yet from her illness is all.” 

“O!” ejaculates Saucy as she relapses to her usual 

self. 

Something rustles under my feet. I pick up a piece 
of American newspaper. Saucy says behind me, “That 
was around my lunch mamma put up. She is still look- 
ing, I suppose,” deeply sighing. 

I carefully read each precious word. A short but

torn excerpt on science contains this : “I said one good 
thing of the soul. That it was electrified after death.” 

I am at sea. It was not Savant’s lore, but my father’s, 
who had deceived me. I go to him with the scrap. He 
reads and smiles, then takes up a leaf near him. Hold- 
ing over it% microscope, I see on it a picture of cloud 
lightening taking a spirit to the sky. A wielder of that 
lightening concealed afar off. I am at sea again. 

I take to studying the leaves myself, seeing how use- 
less to question Savant. 

Charley and Mae too study with me. Still, the latter 
jealously watches Savant. Whose modes and agencies are 
new. Though I see magnetism appear at times, I can- 
not tell how produced (he works in an alcove one side). 

Kvery morning I am a fixture here, studying, mark- 
ing a place on the register to visit in the afternoon. So 
safe am I, now a citizen, I often go alone. Charmed as

I am surprised they show no .solicitude. Mae one time 
is absent a week. Alarmed I go to Savant. He takes 
the register telephones of her position. Then in a shin- 
ing leaf shows me in picture what has passed to her. I 
fee 1 to get up and hug him. But hug Charley who is 
come “You had better go after her,” he says. “Why,/ 
I know all she does.” “Yes, but you should direct whafi 

she does,” wisely. . . , 

I look to the leaf. A new impress is coming. Behind 

her as she is backing unconsciously toward it, is an open 
crevasse trench in use by a workman. I startle the air 
with a scream to Savant, “Call me,” says Charley 
authoritatively, who looks on the plate, to call Savan 
himself. The latter seeing the dilemma, without leav- 
ing his laboratory, touches a button that closes ti 
crevasse behind Mae, as she steps on it safely. I g

“Logic is logic. That’s what / say.”— O. W. //. 

My husband, always so loving so bonny and practical, 
has become sober and long-faced, no shadow ol a smile. 
No hop, skip and jump, like Saucy Mae. Even she he 
passes absent-minded. If she pulls his sleeve, he does 
not heed, so she follows him around to find what the 
matter is. As she makes a body-guard, I leave her to 

watch him. , . 

He has just come out of Savant’s room, absorbed, m 

some papers, he carefully carries in his hand, assorting 
them as he noiselessly walks aloug, the genius behind 
failing to get a peep at their contents. Hearing me ap- 
proach, he hastens to conceal them in the shrubbery, 
disappearing himself. 

Saucy having lost him, takes up with me, and we 
run out and up the street, looking in at various places. 
Seeing familiar faces in a crowd at ail opera house, we 
join them. 

Seeing us, the crowd gives way, and gets up in front, 
where we become the cynosure of the audience (the per- 
formance not having commenced), who look from us to 
the stage, as if in connection, enigmatical to us. 

Puzzled no longer, we see Charley come out and take 
position as speaker. 

Our mouths as well as eyes open in wonder. What 
will happen next? 

With preoccupied bearing, he explains our discovery 
of iron, that raised man from savagery to civilization, 
builds ships and houses. It was well we were before 
him and appreciated his discourse (the home reminiscence 
starts the old pain) for the audience do not understand a 
word he says, but connecting his gestures, they oddly 
imitate the latter. 

He turns to us and changes to an abstruse subject, not 
at all congenial to him. 

“Americans concede three natures to man and five 


ARQTIQ. 


39 


senses. I will show him to possess seven natures, each 
represented by a sense.” We are quite attentive, 
“Touch, first, by his palm, denoting his acquiring 
nature,” I clap my hands. “Taste, second, by his 
tongue, denoting his sustenance nature.” I muse to 
myself, do we kiss because we are cannibals, and would 
like to eat the one we kiss? 

“Social, third, by his lips, denoting his impress na- 
ture.” O yes, that is why we kiss. “Vibrative, fourth, 
his ear, denoting his emotional nature.” I think him 
quite a phrenologist. Mae is some dazed. “Atmos- 
pheric, fifth, by his nose, denoting his steam nature.” 
Mae sends up a prolonged shout. 

“Solar, sixth, by his eyes, denoting his mental 
nature.” I shake my finger at him. 

“Soul, by his hair, denoting electric spirit nature.” I 
come to my feet, raising both hands, as he proceeds. 

“The hair as covering or ornament of the head has 
not received sufficient dignity. As telegraph lines of 
divine construction communes with God, raises its 
value.” I place my hands on each of his shoulders, as 
be finishes impressively. 

“Above the mind, summit of senses, its own power 
only has revealed it even to sight.” 

Remembering him coming out of Savant’s studio, I 
am not surprised. 

But I continue the thread. Does this theory contra- 
vene the immortality of the soul, teach dissolution with 
the body? O, no. 

The operator back of the telegraph machine does not 
integrate with the machine. The telegraph wires down 
do not signify the operator to be in the same condition. 



My spirit lies, with dreamful eyes, 

Beneath the walls of Paradise. 

I catch sight of Show Off coming leisurely toward us. 
Has he caught the last part of the lecture, and is he, 
too, of a studious disposition. For raising his eyes _ 
intelligently, he continues the discourse. “Still we are 
made of dust!” (What can he know of dust?) “Birds,” 
going on, “are made of trees, for their feathers are 
little branches. Fishes are of waterbirth— their scales 
little drops. Beasts of grass, with coats of grass fur. 
Sheep of snow wool.” I am wool gathering. “Reptiles 
have clod skins. We are only of the dust— marble, 
granite or otherwise.” I decide to read him Genesis 
some day. 

But now he speaks up more blithe. “We are going 
to-morrow to Aunt Rohan’s house, where my mother 
Roba is, to get her,” winking his eye at Saucy. 

We are delighted as we return, all together. I look 
at the streets and people, not knowing J shall see them 
no more forever. 

The next morning, that is getting very late, we are 
placed in an open sleigh, to try the new sjnow, in mak- 
ing the trip. As it is a gala day, called Inning Day, so 
everybody is out. “Will everybody be at Robau’s?” I 
ask Show Off, who is holding Saucy by my side. 

“Yes, and more too, for the Traveler will be there, ,, 
he replies moodily. 

“Who is he, and where does he travel?” 

“Up in the sky on his air star,” 

“And what does he do up there?” I smile. 

“He fishes below with a line.” 

I look warily each side of me. 

“Do you like him?” 

“Yes, but he wants me to marry his daughter.” 

“Well?” 

“She wont have me, as she loves my cousin, Aunt

Roban’s son. Her father expects our betrothal at this 
time.” He stops a moment, then resumes. “He is en- 
gaged, himself, to be married to Aunt Robet, who does 
not dare to tell him of his coming disappointment,” 

“How did she, so gentle, ever fancy so douty a man?” 

“It was at a ride. The cavalry were going by so 
swift she became dizzy and was falling, when he by a 
deft move put her back. When he appears, ever since, 
she is like affected. He is coming now.” 

With a start, I look up to the sky, which is clear. 
Then I look about at the cel^brators, thinking he may 
be come to earth, and be among them. And though I 
see a strange mist in the distance, I become occupied in 
studying the various modes of conveyance close around. 
Of every odd design, one vehicle is oddest. It is a 
round glass globe that rolls over and over, bearing its 
inmates upright, ballasted in the interior. It has only 
ladies, so I look ahead. 


Ahead is a bridge, shaped like a flight of stairs (rests 
for the horses). Around the farther tower arches — 
strong supports of the suspended ends — a mist is twining 
and winding, glistening peculiarly. Show Off seeing 
my mtent gaze looks there, and hastily takes from his 
lather s pocket a glass and absorbedly scans the mist. I 
ia forgotten the Traveler’s approach, of shock to 
obet who leans back her head gasping faintly. But 
directly over us is the shocking man, on a high seat

head. The gust shuts ray eyes. But I feel a tiny touch 
that wisps away ray bud. From our slow journeying, 
we are too late to- make our address at Roban s, .before 
the election, which occurs to-day. So proceed to that 
function. Seated comfortably upon the Central Plaza, 
a nice esplanade covered with rugs, we are scarcely 
seated when two ladies and a gent approach us, who by 
their family resemblance are no doubt sisters of Robet. 
One hugs her tremblingly. The other is hugged vigor- 
ously by Savant, his wife Roba. She is, though of 
exact likeness, still of different temperament from the 
others. More sedate, quite stately, though none the less 
lovable. When Savant puts my father with his silver 
‘ hair and shining black eyes on her lap, she is quite 
awe struck. When my father reaches up and kisses her 
reverently on the cheek; she is more nonplussed still, 
and takes her muff to sit him on. 

The gent is no doubt the husband of the other sister, 
who snaps his fingers at Charley, when he wishes he did 
not, for the latter bites if viciously ; then Rubbing the 
bite over, he lays his cheek on it, in penitence. He is 
forgiven, but not taken up on his lap, but I am instead, 
and smile profusely to keep the peace. Saucy is on 
Roban’s shoulder, and chatting like a *parrot into her 
ear, which just suits this lady, she answering as glibly. 

“O, how late you are! We could not wait for you, 
but left the castle open and came on. Has the Traveler 
come?” That individual passes without seeing us. Be- 
fore we hail him, .we hear music of a band approach. 
The melody is whistling as will Boreas shortly whistle 
over the land. 

Conducting two lines in grand march, in election 
mode, headed by the chosen Mayor and Mayoress, 
respectively, or as they call them, god and goddess. 

The evolutions ended, the two lines join, and the crowd 
standing, all sing. 



E’er the sun our father leaves us 
He, as a parent, leads us 
To the indoor mother’s side 
To spend the winter tide. 


The candidates, now in full view, are recognized by 
Robet with consternation. “ Rohan’s son, and his 
daughter,” are her startling words. 

We all turn silently toward Rohan’s home. The 
ceremonies now ended. The new city officers, receiving 
congratulations around, also join our party, staying in 
our rear. 

The castle supposed to be open is not so now, but is 
double barred inside against us, as we arrive. 

Through the crystal portal, we see in the center court, 
sitting nonchalantly as revengeful!} 7 , the man who rode 
over us. We are out in the cold, and what is worse, 
quite hungry. 

Savant calls out, “Hello, neighbor.” He arises and is 
about to come forward, when his daughter laughs out, 
“Now papa, good papa,” which stops him, and he turns 
square his back to us. 

Beyond and near to him is a revolving plant stand, 
reaching high above his head. A plant is moving 
mysteriously. I see my father under a leaf (I had not 
missed him). He is arranging something under a 
blossom. I cannot tell what. 

Now before us and at our feet down drops the nervous 
Robet, who cannot keep her dignity longer. 

Around goes the plant stand and sounds out this 
word, which is from a phonograph (placed by father) in 
Arc, “Look ye.” Around again, it is above him. 
“Looky,” now one side, now behind. Mystified, the 
stolid man looks around as directed, not at our faces, 
where he will see the mirthful countenance of his 
daughter, hut at our feet where he sees a countenance 
pale and in tears. The spell is broken, and as father 
leaps on bis shoulder like a good fairy, he lets us in.

A castle band now starts up to a tune resembling the 
snapping of a fire, reminding us of the day of the Inn- 
ing Fireside. Now crackling forth with renewed zest, 
the people arrange themselves in cavalcade, and sjowly 
march, with spiral inclination, around the hall, towards 
its center. 

Robet, supported by her lover, pulls me out ox her 
bag to amuse him, much to my ill-will. But father 
winks to me over his head, and pulls his hair. Nearing 
the center of the room, the Traveler fiPmly and (I see 
his daughter grimacing close by) turning from the plead- 
ing Robet goes out of the room, and .out of the house, 

' disappearing down the street. 

Wondering at this action, I look for information, to 
to the center gathering, I see a crystal floor in circle 
shape, with round divans in its center. I am mystified 
as we are seated on this divan, and look down at the 
crystal floor. I get a great start, for my feet seem to be 
standing up in the sky, so far down is the crevasse be- 
low, whence comes up a brilliant glow, the only light in 
the apartment now, as blinds and shades are placed to 
protect it. Whence this light arises, I cannot imagine, 
as the sun is not in focus, or other light. 

I take a great like to Rohan, who is as friendly as 
vivacious. I get upon her lap to hear her chat. 

“Good-bye,” she says, “my upper sky home, for the 
winter. My plant stand you may rest until spring (out- 
ing as she calls it)** 

I am mystified why the people stop to sit here, as there 
is no table. 

With a slight jar, the crystal floor now loosens, and 
more surprise, descends. Now beneath the floor, the 
light is increasing, and a warmth also, at which we cast 
off our wraps, displaying evening costume of home. 
The car, I now see it to be, is in triplet decoration. 
Triplet bell clusters favor us with melodies. I wonder 
how long we are descending, when jar, sway, float., asm 
water. I look about. “Where, oh where is this?” 

We are on the bosom of a broad river in a scene of 
tropical beauty and grandeur.

Mae and Charley, as I, are as completely surprised, 
the others enjoying its fulness. 

“Eden, Eden, garden paradise, whence came you 
here?” I weep beside myself in joy. Is this what ex- 
plorers seek? But they will never get here. It is hemmed 
in by the iceberg, two-edged swords, as effectually as 
the other one of our first parents. 

Roban asks, “What is Eden?” I told her of Adam’s, 
and the one to come down to us from the sky. “ No,” 
she says gravely, “the city will grow up to God.” 

Is San Francisco (San-Zion) thus growing? 

I see that Show Off, unlike all the others, is in a grow- 
ing state of excitement. I jump down quickly and 
climb to his side, where he is leaning on the railing of 
the barge, looking expectantly into the water. I punch 
him vigorously. “Tell me, tell me, how came this river 
down here, and its vicinity?” He answers vaguely, not 
looking up, “By the melting of the under ice.” 

“Yes, but to be a flowing river?” 

“We confined it for safety, by dykes and jetties,” be- 
coming quite distraught at some inward thought. Does 
he mourn the Traveler’s daughter ? 

Roban has followed me, and now explains to me more 
fully. 

“When the river got to going good, it melted the ice 
above clear through to the sky.” I look up at the far- 
away opening. # 

“The sky opening, ”she continues, ‘ ‘vegetation started. ’ * 
I look now eagerly at the nearby banks in begonia 
bloom, and crowned with palms. Long aisles of verdure 
penetrate the vista, closed by green sheen. One spec- 
ialty of form is general, that of vine-climbing and up- 
looking. l 

Returning my attention to Roban, she resumes her 
coaching. “Cities too sprang up. We will stop now 
and get some of the luscious fruit,” as the car-barge 
slows and draws up to an orchard station.

decking ourselves with orchids, mimicking songsters. X 
wonder no more where they get their conservatory 
plants. When a bell calls us to dinner. * 

In a bower, vine surrounded and bird enlivened, we 
draw up to board, not a board, either — none, or saws to 
make them are in the land, it is a great lily leaf, hard- 
ened and enameled. 

Indentations serve for places. The food, on small leaf 
trays, arises from the table center dummy lik£. It is in 
mouthful-size pastry cups (that makes me think of home 
tarts), blending grain food with other kinds. Raised 
with the fingers, nothing can be neater. 

The seats are leaves. Springs raise us smaller people 
to a level with the rest. 

I observe greatly rej u veil e ted looks in us and say to 
Charley: “Do you see we are getting younger?” He 
stops picking a pomegranate. “Certainly. It is the 
purity of the atmosphere. Have you noticed, my dear, 
that there has been 5, no dust since our arrival ? And, 
tho’ the sun is constantly shining, no one carries a 
shade or is overheated. Ah, this is the Country to live 
in’” Smacking his lips before starting in again on the 
fruit. 

“Glorious Arc!” I can not say it enough! None 
other place like thee on earth in gorgeous marvels! 
Nearest to God above! I could climb a Pole to see Him, 
hadst thou one! I look around to see the climatic effect 
upon my aged fattier; but he is not here. I remember 
he may be yet on the Traveler’s shoulder for farther 
travel. This somewhat modifies my charm — for a short 
time only, then I give way like the rest to the fulness of 
this Inning Reception. As bright tints float around in 
the air, on the water, and foliage, I wonder what pencil 
but God’s could put them there. 

As we return to the barge Saucy at my elbow grasps 
my sleeve, saying, “Auntie, did you see the team that 
draws the barge? If you did not, look this time, now.” 
What ? — what ? Crocodiles ? 

I stagger back, then renerve myself, reassured that

could be well broke, kept well in hand, presenting an 
innocent pair of open countenances. 

“How odd the water is Auntie,” says Mae, when we 
are calmly seated. v She is looking over the side, then 
rises and crosses to the other. “It is high up on one 
side and low down on the other.” 

Robet speaks without looking up, her eyes intent on 
her nephew, leaning moodily on the railing. “The river 
flows sideways.” 

“How — how can it?” 

“It melts on its inward side, freezing on its outward 
again. ” 

“Making ice for cool drinks,” says the child. 

While dropping in the incline I commenced a study of 
the triplet sisters. Observing them distinct in style with 
the river people (of whom they are, and are now to visit 
their parents, Robet has saidj, I will describe them. 

Tall and sinuous from a constant looking up to the 
sky. A changeable coloring or iridescence enhances 
their supple attenuation. Robet, when musing, as I 
have related in the arbor above, was sober gray eyed; 
when demanding so proudly Charley’s pedigree, intensely 
black-eyed; then, in tears recovering him, her eyes were 
blue, vapor-covered lakes. Seeing this variableness re- 
peated in her sisters I decided it to be constitutional ; I 
looked to see if it was a water reflection. No, for it is 
not on us others. 

Rohan and Roba are on each side getting acquainted. 

To start conversation instructive to myself I ask the 
gracious ladies; “How was it before the country w r as 
dyked into a river?” 

“We were not born then. Our father was contractor 
and has told us how unpleasant were the freshets and 
disasters yearly.” 

“Whole nations were swept away. Did you not find 
any down there?” Roba relates. 

“I never heard, though Adam, the father of all man- 
kind, was very large in size, the people became smaller 
afterwards.” 

Looking earnestly at me I see them change slowly

from blonde to a gray tint, bending tbeir heads in re- 
flection, (I see with great surprise.) 

“We have always been large. I think it is the cold 
zone; its slow revolution causing it. The torrid, as 
Charley says, with its far revolution is very hot,’ > A 
flush on her face as she raises her serpentine head. 

"It gets more sun and the people there are larger, too,” 

I correct. 

Their eyes, my surprise increasing, turn brown as she 
steadfastly gazes. , 

"Then it is not the cold that makes us grow, but pre- 
serves us, giving us great age. We are milleniums old,” 
she breathes gently, chestnut-haired. 

I am transfixed. When able to look up I see a halo 
■round her head; a slight toss and it is dislodged in a ring 
leaving her in violet. 

Going on with her deductions a dawn color follows 
her words. 

"Our great size i§ due to our daylight.” 

"But we have as much as you, tho more subdivided,” 

I correct again. 

"You have not counted our winter daylight,” she per- 
sists. 

"Winter daylight? What is that?” I inquired. 

"From the center of Arc is always arising, from a deep 
cavity there, a constant glow, Auroral In summer it is 
not seen, but all winter we bask in its light.” 

"How is that }) I supposed Aurora only sent up fitful 
lights.” 

Instead, this constant, interspersed with fitful sputter- 
ings, that send the flame so high, lower zones do gaze 
upon it.” Closing a phosphor color enfolds us, then 
rises above. Notes in the waves — trumpet notes con- 
ducted toward us till they sound all about us. Amist- 
like spray is rising around. Looking out I am startled 
to see a large company of people standing on the water 
m the center of the river playing lily-tube trumpets as in 
graceful ease they dance a stately minuet 

Raising aloft their tubes they spray the air with per- 
fumed drops, which, catching the rays of the sun through

the ice-cleft, a glorious rainbow arch settles above as we 
draw to shore and alight upon a wharf of lily pads. 

The sun passes on ahead having kept such even pace 
with us all day that it had appeared to be standing still 
in the sky. The heat had called for our light dress. To- 
morrow it will be in lower horizon. 

We have arrived in a city that is like the people, tall 
and pointing high — a city of slim, needle-like towers. 

Passing toward a mansion I turn to tell Show Off to 
pattern after the young man with the river dancers, 
looking so like him who was gay, when lo! he is not 
with us. 

“It was Show Off himself, Auntie, I saw him put on 
the funny boat-shoes and drop overboard.” 

Who is the young lady he was bending over,’’ I in- 
quire.

lmmicably. ’ 

^ Saucy , I say comically, “he is not for you.” 

I know it, 5 sighing, “I will never have him to carry 
me around on his shoulder.” 

What are Savant and Roba doing ahead, walking up 
the outside of a tower residence? Truly they are and 
our turn come we see plenty of steps and walk up too. 

Arrived at the second story we enter a low gate into 
a circular room the size of the tower. Around the out- 
side is a row of seats which we proceed to occupy In 

Iront of us are promenading round and round the river 
dancers, buoyant in youth. 

From these Show off leads a lustrous river maid and 
presents as betrothed to his family, who can but smile

“All right.” 

She touches a button and we elevate to the top of fhe 
tower. A branch of clove-scented vine brushes my cheek. 
Seeing me peer down Robet hands a glass to see into 
the shade of the tropical park beneath. 

Seeing me occupied she bends down her head in medi- 
tation. Then sighs and sighs to herself, bravely 
struggling with these breakers in her love stream. 

I am examining each detail in the grounds beneath. 
From the palm leaf that is so strong Saucy runs up and 
slides down it. Tired of this she picks an odd blossom 
in shape of a tiny cupid with drawn bow. At her touch 
shoots the tiny arrow and to break in fragrance. Would 
that all Love’s arrows were so sweet. I suddenly realize 
where the verdure of Upper Arc is produced, as familiar 
forms greet me, faithfully growing up as to the summer 
day. Where are they now? Glass protected in upper 
arbor. v 

Tired of the Cupids, Mae now rolls over and over in 
the grass with abandon of childish glee until she sud- 
denly comes upon two lovers -Show Off and Serpenta (I 
have named) which latter smiles her a welcome, stoop- 
ing down to raise her to where they sit, a long, slim, 
rope looking swing or hammock. But Mae starts back 
with a scream, which makes me look close. O, dear, it 
is the live folds of a boaeonstrictor. 

I get faint as Robet looks up and takes in the situation. 

“Do not fear,” she says, “it does not eat children, it 
is better fed.” 

Imagining she is laughing at me I brace up to great 
bravery, asking, “Can I ride, too?” 

“Yes, we will go down, look out;” the latter in refer- 
ence to the chair upon which I sit— one of a row of seats 
around the tower edge, facing outward. I look quite 
curiously and assure myself its rails are in front as on 
each side of me, inclosing me quite secure. Connecting 
it to her own, she presses on them heavily downward. 
Feeling warned, as curious I feel the top bend over for- 
wards. still more. I hold quite fast. My head is now 
where my heels have been. This is not all ; increasing 
the velocity we complete the revolution, and repeat it to

tbe foot of the tower, where I come standing, red with 
vexation (the idea of a lady of ray age rolling down the 
side of a house), my temperate zone stomach quite upset. 

But “click” at the top. There is Roba in similar 
chair, who signifying that she will join us is about to 
round the edge. I recover my temper in anticipation of 
being witness to her acrobatic descent— stateliness com- 
bined. , But no; she slowly goes over, smoothly, down 
to the bottom dignifiedly — right side up with care. I 


turn reproachfully to Robet. 

“ I thought you were in for a frolic,” she says inno- 
cently. , 1 

This restores my gaiety and we return to the arbor 

with zest and join the jolly crowd who are making the 
warden ring. They make room for me on the boa, where 
I ride, the danger enhancing the delight. I regret to get 
down for others. As I do so, the great graceful head of 
the boa swings close to me, the mouth opens, the eyes 
dart fire ; then next I discover it is an art manufact rc

ders.” 

Roban is getting social, “There are not many lions 
now. They were dangerous ; the city filling up has 
thinned them out. Do you want one ?” 

I am still in chagrin, so answer crossly the sweet-tem- 
pered lady, “What for ? Will it take me home on its 
back ?” 

She eyes me sideways, still serene. Do you want to go 
home?” I choke up in golden silence. “When you want 
to go the Traveler will take you.” complacently. 

Roused to ire at my earnestness being taken for jest, 
I launch out disrespectfully, “That crusty man would 
drop me over an iceberg and think his duty done.” 

She does not heed me as her sister Robet is now ap- 
proaching quite rosy cheeked, and is about to dance me 
up and down, which I never allow, when I can help my- 
self. 

Roban says to her sorrowfully, “The little dear is go- 
ing home with the Traveler.” 

I smile, then say to Robet, “When he and you are 
married I will go.” Then I eye her sideways.

says my church raises money untruthfully in its fairs and 
suppers.

American (oh no !) a man like us little folks is in the 
sky , sonic day he will come down and make us golden 
streets,” smiling broadly.

“How is that? they being the children of tree and

“I never thought of that,” but continue: 

“All dead will come to life.” 

“Where is the room for them?” 

“All bad men will be killed off.” 

“Who will kill them off? ” 

“He that comes out of the sky.” 

“Their spirits would haunt him.” 

“He would kill their spirits, too.” 

“None but God can do that.” 

“He is the Son of God.” . , _ 

“O, is God married?” so impiously, I lose heart. 
But Roban comes to my aid. With shining expectant 

eyes she now interrogates me, 

“When will He come?” I shake my head. 

' " “ Who will He bring to life ? ” persisting. 

“Those who love Him. O dear, dear Roban, do you 
love God ?” I am pleading for a soul. 

“That I do,” is her positive confession. 

“Do you love His Son?” my hands clasped toward 

her. 

“Anything that belongs to Him,” so beatifies me I 
spring to my feet to declare: 

“Then you will be saved, for love is the fulfilling of 

the law.” 

Drops sprinkle all about. I look back of me to see 
Saucy with inspired face who has been listening*# Thus 
bestowing this rite upon this new convert, who strangely 
takes on a serious look. 

“I know whom you mean,” she says. “He does like 
this,” pointing her hands as in prayer. What can she 
mean? 

“He comes here to teach us.” 

“Who, who? It cannot be He, the Son. Does the 
spirit of an apostle transfigured appear in this city — this 
city of love? I am astounded.” 

“He says that in a century hence electricity will create 
a human being.” 

What can she mean? Is the camera-eye, telephone-

ear to be supplemented by a dynamo head, put on 
locomotive lungs and stood on wheel feet? 

Truly here is sympathy in Arc for such invention. 
Twenty-four hours without sleep. I yawn so terribly. 
Robet anxiously straightens me out on a chair for repose. 

I dream in shadow of friends and home. Saucy’si 
mother hugs her close. 

ilTSxt my chair is moved easily along and I open my 
eyes iiVan ice grotto, where a large company is assembled, 
whom"! imagine are the many relatives. 

As older people, like them in feature are occupying 
special chairs of state— the parents? 

The change to cool arbor from summer heat is so 
greatly refreshing I regain animation. 

At the parents’ request, we are placed on pedestals for 
exhibition. 

“Are all so small? ” they inquire. 

We are medium. There are. midgets and giants ” we 
reply. ° * 

. “ffcw greatly you have multiplied. How greai the 
size of the earth in comparison with Arc. You do more 

wmnderful acts in proportion as you have more land to 
worK upon. 

They place their hands upon our heads in token of 
membership in their family. 


/ 


“There is magic in the air.” 


Another pedestal is being occupied by Show Off and 
Serpenta, who are dancing a betrothal. In graceful 
pose and gesture, his movements are an epic poem in 
majesty and solid grandeur, her’s the duplicate shadow 
of his, with interlacing quicksteps. An ice dance on 
the ice, the feet not raised off. The complication of 
steps is insidious to the eye in their noiseless turns. 
Noiseless? rising on the air is a melody, that grows and 
lessens, produced by the swift slipping. Ending in smooth 
tone as true love ought. 

When it is over, and the company dispersed, I wander 
around by myself to soon get lost in the tangle of halls, 
which labyrinth every way. Just here are niches in the 
walls with statues of people and animals like life. Here 
is a family group. The host is deep in Arc news ball 
(writing rolled up) his wife is crossing the floor toward 
the grandma, asleep in -her arm chair, a kitten rolled 
up beside it. A child is playing on the floor. I touch 
its soft , hair. It is cold. An idea enters my mind. 
Have not all these been once alive, and now ice em- 
balmed? I intrude no farther. None look up to ask me 
to stay. A charm comes over me driving all uncanny 
sense away. How pleasant to have our dead welcome 
among us, as though not lost. 

Now I come to rooms of birds and other pets. A boa 
that swung Robet in olden time. What is this, an 
elephant like the mammoth, ice-locked in southern zone 
Washed away? 

“O auntie!’ ’ 

I turn nervously around. It is not Miss Mae but 
Miss vSerpenta. Show Off’s betrothed, who has mistaken 
my name. 

Miss Robet is in the great hall, where Charley (^mis- 
take) is going to lecture. It is superbly decorated, a 
great globe of the earth in the center, colored. He will

tell all about it. He has counted out a thousand and 
one inventions never seen here. He says he will 
lionize the natives. She told me to find you, for though 
any can enter an open archway, none can open a closed 
door.” ' 

I begin to feel as if Blue Beard lived here. The open 
rooms are so magnificent and shining one need not hunt 
him up. 

“The cue in the halls,” goes on the friendly girl, “is 
to keep on the smooth path. The lecture will soon be- 
gin. She is afraid you will take cold or something and 
wants you by to watch you.” 

“To watch me!” I muse maliciously. “Did I come, 
clear to Arc to be watched by an old maid, an old one 
truly ? ” 

/ turn to the rough path. What is that under that 
chair? I do believe it is a paper. Charley has dropped 
some of his notes. I am so tired. I will sit down while 
I pick them up. Why don’t they come out? I get up 
and*perceive the chair is an open work door, solid built. 

“O,” says Serpenta, trembling, as I hurry to undo the 
bar.,-- She is paralyzed. As I open the door a little way, 
I see in the jar a Blue Beard, I said the lions are pink, 
this one is blue. His paw on the paper, his breath on 
me. No art manufacture now. 

I dream in shadow. I see Show Off, who has followed 
his girl, with one tremendous blow put us two around an 
archway. The lions are in the room. They mind him 
not. When did a king mind ? They see me not. I see 
them from reflections on the ice mirror walls. 

I He leans against a column and plays. (He has in his 
V mouth a harmonica, Saucy’s property.) Plaintive at 
first, then shrill, one note touches a chord in the lions’ 
ears. They shake their heads. It comes again. They 
snort. A mother back of them calls to a lost babe; three 
heroes go to her aid flying. The door is shut. Tableau. 

The lecture is very good. When it comes to lions I 
am surprised to see in the archway behind Charley, no 
less than Show Off astride his young thoroughbred, who 
/ w ^ en lionS ar e said to dance and play music in America! 
this ope dances and plays behind the speaker, who looks

back wild eyed. The harmonica in its mouth, Show Off 
chokes out the strains with his hands. So apt and 
comical is it, the speaker himself breaks out laughing. 
Show Off has learned to read Unit writing. He got the 
paper under the door. Did not get left by a Unit scion. 

I am sitting by the girl, who says: 

“I could listen all day about the marvelous people 
when Aunt Robet takes you home I will go along. ” 

“O say no more, I implore. I feel so lost when I think 
of home.” 

“To-morrow,” I see she is going to make me happy 
again, “I will take you over the city. It is one of many 
that occur every ten miles. This side the river is our 
summer home, the other is our winter.” 

The next morning I take to the tower top and delight 
myself by discovering another motion still of the chairs. 
It is a circle whirl which I practice until I feel I am 
seasoned to any mode of motion sprung on me. 

Serpenta seeks me out, and asks me sweetly what 
place we shall visit first. 

“O, no matter.” 

“A library ? ” 

“Very well.” 

She connects our chairs securely, as did Robet, and 
presses them to motion, without saying as did Robet, 
“look out.” 

We are moving — how, how? Iler “look out,” had 
she said it, would have helped , one less than Rohet’s. 
For this is worse — so much more worse. 

Not so exhilarating, quite the opposite. I am losing 
my breath in a faint, so utterly unprepared am I, for we 
are moving straight out into space. I look sideways to 
see Serpenta calm. I look in front, if to see a track, 
none there. Nothing above or below to hold, not even 
a wire. Still we are steady and aim to another tower 
top that is rapidly nearing. Now we stop on it. I get 
down and wmlk around my chair to find its wizard 
action. No track, did I say ? There is a track — good 
rail track behind. It pops into my head it is after the 
method devised some years ago for a railroad to lay its 


5 8 arqtiq. 

track as it went, ? but must have land to lay it on. This 
carries and steadies its supplements — bridge-like. 

We descend the elevator into an elegant room of. many 
windows and' drapery, seat ourselves beside one, high 
and wide. The scene outside is exquisite. Some fur-clad 
people are on the ice around a fire cocking. A ship in the 
distance is ice locked. 

But there is no ice in this neighborhood. 

“How do you like the picture?” asked Serpenta 
eagerly. 

“O, the window is a picture; it is fine/' I reply en- 
lightened. 

“Is it like your people that go in ships ? ” 

“They must be the last explorers whom Savant found. 
How I wish I could rescue them and bring them into 
Arc.” 

“Did you say this is a library, where are the books? ” 

She presses on the picture frame; it changes as a part 
advances, opens and is a book. The back was part of 
the picture. It is Savant’s story in pictured writing and 
quite enlists my sympathy. Seeing me tearful she t ikes 
me outside and leaves me in a shrubbery plot, while I 
attempt to compose my features. 

Hearing a sob from someone else close by, I am upset 
again and weep in sympathy. I peer through the low- 
lying branches and see Robot in a mossy nook, giving 
way to hysterical bitterness, her hands over her face. 

Now, two other hands pull them away to give her 
view of the laughing face of Show Off. She pushes him 
off spitefully. Partly losing his balance, he settles back 
on his heels, still laughing, seeing which with her toe 
she completes his overthrow and leaves him in the moss 
as she continues unconstrained her grief. 

Show Off picks himself up sobered and looks around 
for other occupation. I do also view the surroundings. 

I perceive this building is over the river. Before I salute 
Robet, she arises and stamps away. 

Passing my retreat I hear her moan: 

“You are lost, O my darling.” 

Something drops gently upon my hand. I look down

to see a round button-like object attached to a line that 
goes up above. 

• I raise it, when the string sways out from the tree, 
free from aught else but the sky. 

I feel in my fiand a signal, which I recognize. By my 
knowledge of Arc as a “hello,'’ which I answer back. 
Then comes a communication: 

“I am aw r ay up in the sky. Who are you ? " 

Thinking some trick is being played on me I answer: 
“Robet.” 

Ting a ling ling. They are happy. (Can it be the 
Traveler?) 

Hoping so, I telephone on the line, in Robet’s voice: 

• “It is my darling ! ” \ 

I hear back: “It is sounding from the clouds in accents 
of her voice. O, clouds, speak again.” 

“When will my darling come again? ” 

“Do you want me, dear? I will wander no more. 
But it is fine up here. I go like light. Thoughts cannot 
travel faster.” 

“My darling is like. a spirit of air for speed.” 

“I will speed to you, dear.” 

“His daughter pines for him.” 

“Not her.”

jected to a solution, is shrunk to microscopic dimensions. 
Other occupations are on each side, extending in a line. 

On the farther side of each room are windows looking 
outside. The school rooms being divided from the inner 
halls and libraries by the umbrageous alley, in which we 
sit. 

Wheeling my seat ahead (which goes, tree and all, a.s 
though one piece on rollers) Show Off explains: 

“This school or fair, as Charley calls it, (would I 
could take it home for exhibition) is devoted to silk.” 

I see in process of construction pictures, screens, gar- 
ments, carpets (which I had taken for sward) with 
American articles devised from Charley’s lectures. These 
last are brought out to me for my benefit. A worker 
' hands me a glass of water, which another puts a bouquet 
of flowers into, on which lights a canary and sings a 
song, as a fuzzy dog puts up his paws at my side. All 
are silk. 

Down spinning comes a spider. I did not like its 
looks. It opens its mouth saying: 

“Come into my parlor.” 

I turn away saying: “No American parlor this, but 
fairyland, sung of poets and imagined in spirit by paint- 
ers. As I become absent-minded, Show Off closes the 
doors and leaves me alone. 

I look straight up into the sky, thinking of the button, 
when an odd little sky speck attracts my inquisitiveness, 
for it is growing larger very fast, as jt no doubt is com- 
ing down very fast. Strangely heavy for a fleecy cloud, 
which it looks to be. Down to the opening, through to 
the tower top it stops by my side. The cloud is off, as 
outsteps father and Saucy, and I spring convulsively to 
mv feet off the rock I had leaned op in ease. 

.J m 

Holding my hands together Mae quiets my nerves. 

“O, auntie,” with glowing cheeks' and shining eyes 
of sky angel. “Did you not know they do this here? 
,See, this is the string of the cloud balloon I hold.” 

“But Mae, the Traveler is up there and is not 
friendly,” 

“O, Grandpa has been civilizing him, so I have asked 
him to the wedding.”

Ah Arc ! Highest of all ! Yet is death ever beneath ! 

Resuming our seats I bethink me of Saucy’s proposi- 
tion: 

“Going home, Saucy ? ” 

“Yes, to America.” 

“To America ! ” I echo again. 

“Yes, will this be an easy way ? ” getting up and 
coming to take hold of me, as though I was to be scared. 

“An easy way.” I cannot think what she is driving 
at, when it comes out. i 

“Yes, the wmy we are sailing in the air.” 

I clutch the rock (as did Fitz James) muttering as did 
he, “This rock shall fly from its firm base, as soon as I.” 

But too late, the rock is flying with me on it through 
the air in combination of the rest on the plot. Tower 
and schools are leff behind, so quick done I had been un- 
observant. 

By effort accepting the situation, I turn to Show Off, 
jocularly : 

“How far can this go ? ” in reference to the proposition. 

“To the sun, if you want a rcorcher,” lie answers with 
assurance. 

“I have been studying, Auntie.” She studying, “We 
can place relays of these over the border. 

“But the compass?” I interrupt. 

“We will measure straight between each relay until 
the compass rights itself,” sitting down herself content- 
edly. 

I get up and choke ‘her with a hug. “You blessed 
child, given me a way to get home.” 

I forgive her immediately and all the rest for the 
dreadful scares I have been victim. I think of home 
scenes, so far away, and compare with these of this de- 
lightful land. I must confess, I prefer as magnificence, 
these. But the blessed mascot has studied how to get 
home. 

It being possible, my full spirits rebound. 

“Next spring will do to go,” I say, anxious now to 
stay, where before I was anxious to go — now that I 
could. 

The next day I am so light of heart and light of step

I take trust that my old statue heaviness cannot again 
weigh me down. 

Initiated to the schools, as the place where all work,- 
(Arc life above, mostly a recreation) I become alert to 
choose an industry. Saucy arriving, takes from her 
pocket silk and needle, deftly fashions a butterfly, which 
she affixes, waving to my shoulder. As I ask: “What 
can I do ? ” 

“O, you can print the books you write, you know. 
And Charley,” laughing, “can paint.” 

■ The days fly swiftly by. The sun has rounded down 
toward the horizon. Twilight is our only day. Clouds 
skim the blue sky. Cream foam in portend of storm, 
driving us to the warmth of the towers that are now get- 
ting a layer of arctic protection. 

Bright days only let us out to tour the cities, making 
the round trip roundly. Kach tour develops a new 
specialty, marvelous and absorbing our interest, 
Though the upper sky, out of the crevasse, is getting a 
soft black color, still the air around has a light of its 
own that is not artificial in any sense — proceeding from 
the center aurora, that ‘is becoming oftener in action. 
Scanning it closely one day, as I am returning home, I 
mistake the door and curiously look around at the grand 
hall in which I find myself. 

The walls, like all others, shining and sparkling, are 
here, strangely glimmering and glinting, quite dazing 
in y eyes. 

I ask a slim little Arc maid I see walking about in 
absorbed fashion, “What place is this? ” 

“Holy Hall,” is her impressive reply. 

“Then you have a church after all. Do you pray to 
God ? ’ ’ 

“Not in words as you. God knows before.” 

“Then what is Holy Hall? ” I persist. 

“Where people are holy.” 

“O, what makes it glisten so ? ” 

“It holy spiritualizes all within.” 

“Then no evil spirits can come to this communion of 
saints.” Quite bestows comfort and relief. 

The walls are landscaped in crackled scenery, and at

“O is this where Rohan saw the scientific angel . _ 

I rigidly regard the one nearest to me to see it being 
occupied by a familiar f ice and form. (Familiar by en-

A hand appears from the air, resting on his arm, which 
slowly materializes the form to which it is attached. 

I open my mouth in awe, for I recognize again Presi- 
dent Lincoln — the martyr , as joining him in touch 
appear his generals. My memory .goes back to that 
struggle of civil strength, at the sight. 

Then I strive to awaken myself, as though I must 
have fallen strangely asleep, scarcely believing the illu- 
sion before me. 

Not crediting the tales of spiritualist societies, I can- 
not likewise discredit the Bible records. Knowing I 
have not, as likely the excellent souls in Arc, have not, 
in wantonness profanely tempted this array, I, in defer- 
ence to the manifestation, wait resignedly. I clasp my 
hands in added awe as Sivant touches me to inquire: 

“Who are they ? ” 

“Upon the other side of our country’s father has ap- 
peared. Ah, who ? Jefferson Davis and his gray-clad 
staff.” 

I wring my hands as Savant touches me again. 

“There was a war,” I gasp. “I)o they hear? They 
look down and smile at me, even the rebel, at whom I 
shake my finger. 

“You earned it, to be a President. You tried to cut a 
gieat country in two; • deluging it in blood.” 

In my electric state I see the root ol the real cause — 
ambition of earthly state. I he root of evil that grew to 
a tree of distrust of brother to brother, Kach aroused in 
strength of pride to combat of their separate interests.

What? A Crown of Radiance arisen there. A solemn bell 
tolls forth; streams of light are shed around in spectrum 
sparks ; the river banks are deserted ; the towers 
tenantless, as each citizen hastens to the inner aisles of 
verdure depths, where issues shadowed fire. 

I keep pace with Savant, whom first I see and reach 
with him an inner balcony that is endless in curving 
ring each side, making amphitheater 'around the city. 
The center is a great open rotunda, of fields, miles broad, 
of shaking ice. A flame of gold supplying the Crown 
above ascends out of a round cavernous crater in the 
center. 

Savant seats himself on a raised broad platform, com- 
manding a view of the whole scene. I unconsciously 
sit beside him. Beneath our feet I see a rug of “hel”io- 
trope. (Note. The quotation marks in the flowers give 
a double meaning. A “hel” meaning heel on the rug.) 
A hedge of “wall” flower hems us in from a row of 
poplar tree columns. Before us on a table is spread a 
set of * ‘China” asters under a canopy of blue iris (flag). 
As Canterbury “bells” ring forth, we begin a feast. 

The centerpiece is a large “sweet-pea” cock, flanked 
by “chick” weed on each side, “butter”cup, “pica”lily 
and “pitcher”plant have places. 

Alarm at my heart at the solemn tolling bell had 
hastened my feet hither. To find a scenic banquet is some-

what puzzling, The usual ascending glow, with its 
usual reversal of shadows, is augmented by the added 
source, in new portraiture, adding to the picturesqueness 
of the occasion. Taught at home that all people without 
Christ are barbaric, I was expecting an abject worship 
of the disturbed elements. Instead I am pleased as sur- 
prised to find it an inspiration of interest only. 

I look to get their knowledge of the phenomena. For 
its solution I have left home and risked my life. 1 hat they 
fear it not, is evident. Instead they love and reverence its 
benefaction to them — lighting and warming their homes 
all winter; their winter daylight— -as Roban said, in their 
interior winter quarters. Unusually quiet this season so 
far, but this is to outdo all, make up for lost time, un- 
precedented in grandeur. That they understand it I am 
solicitious to know. I could catch a word now and then. 

I could understand in the voluble tonic, stream of talk 
I read from their gestures and expressive faces some 
meaning of their patriotic interest. 

The morning banquet at an end, all sit back in their 
seats and look at Savant as though some special cere- 
mony is to ensue. Thoroughly excited, I see him hold a 
state book and read: 

“We receive again God’s sign of the disturbance of 
aurora — our beautiful mother in the earth— who gathers 
us each winter around her fireside to comfort us in its 
warm beams. 

“What is aurora ? ’’ 

“Yearly we ask this question. None have answered 
us. We yearly invite our subjects to explore her con- 
fines, whence she lights her beacon. W r e invite now.” 

“Who will descend the Glory Hall to pay devoirs to 
the country’s goddess.” 

I had followed him quite plainly When he stopped, 
in the silence that followed a great light filled my eyes, 
as the idea that engendered it filled my mind. 

I a“rose” in my seat, which latter is a rose vine — ■ 
insignia of aurora— which word I hear in suppressed 
intuition in application to myself as a branch of bloom 
settles on my head wreath-like. Raising my hands in 


ARQTI Q. 69 

acceptance of the undertaking, they look calmly at me, 
incredulous, when I speak in full earnest tones: 

“I will go, God of the universe, Creator of aurora has 
led me hither for that purpose.” 

Sitting again, they are convinced, and much upset in 
their /calculations, that I so small should answer the 
gre^t: request. 

yin their surprise I get full revenge of all I have been 
"subject of so long. 

Now, all look at Savant, which occasions me to do the 
same. The phenomenal wave of thought, individual to 
him, wraps his countenance in stormy struggle. He 
speaks: 

“We cannot accept, in duty to guest and stranger.” 
But I gesture firmly. 

Again he is submerged with greater struggles to ex- 
haustion of his great strength, when an enduring calm 
arises in his face, like a smiling island in a hurricane 
tossed sea. Waving his hands, as I had done, he speaks: 

‘T will take you.” 

All arise in consternation and press about us. Mae, 
wild-eyed, shakes me back and foith. Father buries his 
face in his hands. Roba and Charley only, clap their 
hands. The tide now turns in our favor; all is pleasant 
bustle. The tender social visiting of their usual tenor 
and normal habit is changed to agitation in concocting 
a mode of preparation to ensure our safety, resulting in 
an elaborate scheme of training, to which we are sub- 
jected, separately, next day. 

Bandaged securely we are rolled about and tossed. 
Suspended to a long rope we are dangled in mid air, 
swung in a circle with increasing speed. Hands are 
waved before us, jumping and shouting indulged in to 
harden our nerves. Left alone, click, the floor beneath 
is loosening, revolving, opening, black darkness ensues, 
then lights glimmer around; bells, whistles and reverber- 
ations fill all the air with din, followed by melody so low 
as scarcely to be heard — the music of the spheres. 

This has taken days, as it has been necessary to repeat 
each lesson, over and over. Quite unnecessary, I think, 
is so much pains of preparation.

Readers, what is to ensue, is the special key to tue 
phenomena of Astronomy. For the contents of the next 
few pages, I have written this story. 

I am not the first who has thought the earth to be 
hollow and entered at the Arctics. Also that a rolling fire, 
and open sea, are within. That I define this fire, and its 
safe control , thereby discovering the secret of our planet, 
and its object in the solar system, is the first time such 
definition has been given ever. Is of such high import- 
ance I deem it my solemn duty to publish it. 

Adding a relevant definiton of the Sun, and other sky 
objects, is but following out the line, struck by the first 
keynote. 

In comparison with the present indefinite theory, this 
illustration far exceeds it in practical demonstration — 
ever satisfactory to truthful students. 

Shelly in the time of Byron voiced this promise of the 

Arctics. 

Poets have sung of its unknown city. 

Capital and life have ever embarked for its discovery.

its grandeur startling. Transfixed, I see it grow, as it 
is plainly coming up higher. To relieve my eyes I look 
to one side to see its appurtenances, only to find none. 
The sides of the cavern are far away and undiscernible. 
I am puzzled. Resolving to understand this unexpected 
bearing, I look first at my watch. A new puzzle is on 
its face. Its calendar declares the passage of days since 
I have been here. I turn square to the beautiful moon 
beneath me and bravely steady my understanding, for a 
queer unrest sensation is trying to creep on me. 

1 hough I throw it off, in its terrifying aspect, yet it 
wraps me round and permeates my consciousness. 
That this moon, now so quiet and glittering, is not only 
the fire producing the Aurora smoke, but something 
more. The painful solicitude of Arc people at letting 
me do this daring act, that to me looked like mockery 
is demonstrative of their better understanding. If Sa- 
vant knew what was to happen, I cannot say, for I can- 
not speak to him, nor he to me, nor see each other’s 
faces. I am alone with the problem I have put myself 
m. My old statue sense upholds me. I lean on it as I 
place straight the lines of new knowledge— that the moon 
I see is not a moon, but the central fire of the whole 
earth — the molten mass of astronomical science. 

That it ooes not fill the whole center is second new 
knowledge, for a haze of distance is each side and above 
denoting far removal of the earth crust, egg shell un- 
discoverable even by the powerful lens of the crystal 
globe around me. Central of the earth, it may be thous- 
ands of miles below, though slowly growing. My strained 
eyes take its impress on their inner orbs. Wherever I 
look it is there. I settle bravely to scan it, enchanted

our hall lamp do at home when disturbed by air currents. 

Lamp! Lamp! Is the earth a lamp? 

Before me is the key note. 

Hiss, crack! it is our life preserver — the iceberg be- 
neath us. Melted to vapor it will ascend and carry our 
globe to Arc again. 

Listening with wildly beating heart in intense sus- 
pense, I become unconscious as fiery serpents twine be- 
neath me. 

At last recovered I look again; but no longer there. 
Ah, above? Have we passed it? 

Below it and still descending. I lean heavily and 
wholly on my statue. The days make no impress on 
me. Not even when I see the sky out of southern zone'. 
Coldly viewing the Southern Cross Constellation of sun 
stars, the planet Mercury comes between, taking on a 
peculiar distinct phase. I sluggishly remember that in 
a mine the planets are seen thus at noon-day. Ah ! is 
the earth’s center to be a mine to me? 

My eyes become exhilarant as I quickly investigate. 
I can see its (Mercury’s) rivers, mountains plainly. I 
can see into it. As I get excited, I see an inside flam- 
ing fire, as earth’s. Then it is— -yes, a lamp, also. 

The planets lamps? Where are their chimneys? I 
inspect again. There certainly is no chimney to guard 
the draught. I will study. Oh, why did I not notice 
before, it is more like a Chinese lantern — candle inside, 
colored shade outside. 

I look in ecstasy for days. It is, as is our dear 
mother earth, a beautiful Japanese lantern; made by 
Deity’s hand to revolve around the glowing sun. 

A sun ray spectrums the interior of earth. O, beam 
alive with electric, spirit intelligence, give me a sign. 
The sun itself comes. My eye, on fire, looks into its 
soul. O, sun, what art thou ? Worshiped by some as 
God, by all as a great life giver. Ages past and future 
will you roll, unguided by man. 

I am now so hot I wonder if I have partly warmed the 
inside of my statue being, (so wholly benumbed I be- 
came at the knowledge of passing below the earth’s 
center, inside light— losing all shadow of hope of seeing

Arc again— that my marble state was more than ever 
marbleized). Now that I am treated, in lieu of home, to 
new explanations of past astronomical phenomena, is 
some recompense to my constitutionally enthusiastic 
mind. - 

Holding down an equally strong impulse to desire to 
tell this new acquisition, I let it unfold to myself to warm 
me under my marble shield. What follows fast? Vision 
upon vision is enlarging my interior sense of human life, 
until my outside is only cold. My whole inner is seeth- 
ing in ardor until mv eyes break through the statue 
thrall. Too hasty — the light blinds me. I close them 
impatiently; open slowly. 

Is the sun a China lamp? O, no, no; but an American 
electric arc light. I hurrah unrestrainedly! 

Around it dance its gay planets as it sits and beams 
warmly upon their atlas garniture- -a round crystal-globed 
lamp. I see a marking on the disc. Does it designate 
a disturbance within? It grows and changes. Would 
that some astronomer were here. The globe in which I 
sit is steady in its motion, but the marking on the sun 
changes oft. I look up toward the earth flame to see 
coming from its side more coals and smoke; also so far 
one side as to clear its blaze safely, is a huge mass — yes, 
ice — coming swiftly directly over me. Having collected 
all this hard winter, it has rolled over the edge of Arc to 
complete my destruction for my daring temerity. Re- 
solving to retain consciousness, I look downward at the 
sun spot. It has changed ; is changing, as does the ice 
mass above me. Can that mass,' in eclipse from the 
light above, be the spot? I believe it is, and that it will 
now strike us. 

Hitting only on the edge of our anchor, ice, it spins 
the globe off into space, over and over, vapor spouts ad- 
hering. But I have seen behind us a slim stationary 
object. Is it ? Oh, is it a fixture to hold the earth flame? 

Relieved of our heavy ice we gravitate to it (as the ice- 
mass evaporates, filling the interior with Aurora prisms. 
These escaping at both northern and southern zone out- 
let, are certain proof of the attending phenomena). 

Sliding along its length we curve toward the side of 


74 


ARQTIQ. 


the earth which I shall hope soon to see. Coming at 
last far away, like a cloud, now to it, we dip down (or 
the rod fixture on which we slide, as though some inner 
electric lode drew us). 

This quite mysterious direction engages my study as 
we pass under the earth-crust, as it, China-lantern trans- 
parent like, curves by above us as if in a rim. I study; 
why the crust of the earth turns round and round, and 
not the rod ! Surely no earthly lantern is so elaborately 
constructed. 

Engaged in study I find myself outside. The rod 
arises now in height of location and branches to each 
side of the crust-rim, fork like. Extending, we go out, 
out toward the sun. As we lightly bound hither and 
thither, side and about, I catch a backward glance of the 
continent America. Tears fill my eyes. As I press them 
out I see approaching a white cliff on the rod, covering 
its width. This side are crowding a swarm of tiny 
people absorbed in dislodging a huge boulder of which 
the ground is covered. Clinging about them is a\semi- 
transparent vapor that floats and densities, collecting 
over their heads. They jump into the air, whirl over 
harlequin like and descend to push again the boulder. 

No sign of vegetation; there must be no stir. Can the 
vapor be their breath? Why does it not float away? In 
the globe I have tubes to my nose that supply my breath. 

The little fairies, are they (I pinch myself) getting 
into mischief? An adult makes peace by administering 
sharp pinches. As one moves its mouth to howl, I do 
too, but cannot make a sound; neither does the child 
who cries without. I see the reason. A thin filmy 
gauze surrounds it confining the vapor breath. 

Over goes the boulder lightly as if hollow. Losing its 
rod gravitation it flies off toward the earth and disap- 
pears, ( dashing on its surface — an aerolite). 

Ere they select another we enter their midst. Not 
seeing us within, they grasp the globe and roll it over. 
Seeing a debris marring its shining surface they pound 
it off. This removed from the fastening Savant swings it 
open, Pandora-box -like, as off they rush. Winding carefully 
his breath tubes about him, Savant takes tools, solutions, 


A^QTIQ. 


75 


etc., and stepping out carefully inspects the boulder’s 
surface. (Are they the dust on the rod ?) Selecting one 
he quickly works. Indents and excavates a large round 
cavity, disclosing a glittering black diamond interior, 
disappearing inside as he works. I, curiously steer the 
globe to the entrance. The inside smooth he places a 
block in the center, obvious as rest to the globe which I 
* steer to and stop on, seeing myself an equal distance 
- from the interior sides. Satisfied, he proceeds to throw 
- — —a solution over the latter, which brings out a picture or 
Reflection from the globe-disc, camera-like. Is the 
. picture the interior of the earth ? I scan it curiously. 

After the ice border (around the north pole) land with 
one only vegetation, a white cactus. White is the color 
of the whole inside Except some blackened spots. The 
cactus skin is clothing of a people who appear, who eat 
the pulp and work the thorns into houses and into ships 
as water, first shallow, deeper grows; and again into 
forts upon the cacti branches growing up out of the water, 
thorn protected from sea monsters. Then these last 
range alone. 

A great blur where we passed the light, more sea in- 
cludes the lower half. 

I exclaim to myself in bitter mood, is this all ! 

I am quite disenchanted. Is this our brother earth 
man? So flat; more wide than tall, who cannot lift his 
feet on account of his centrifugal location ; thorn artists • 
skewering hair, umbrella like. Nesting on trees as high 
as Jack’s beanstalk. A shade outside draws us hastily 
there. ^ How came this emerald lawn with ruby roses 
sapphire lilies, made of the gem rock centers. 

The shade increasing relieves my eyes to see distinctly 
As the tiny artists finish their work by sprinkling the 
sparkling dust over themselves and resume their jubilee 
racket. Suddenly I get an odd sense that they are dif- 
ferent from ordinary human beings. Grace in every 
motion. Fair flowing hair; deep-dell gray eyes are of 
plain human being species. Still I notice strongly a 
difference as they gather now and hurriedly consult 
Children and adults. Are the latter all mothers or fathers? 

I cannot tell.

Before solution dawns I look up and find the moon is 
approaching close over. Is it whence the unique mites 
have their origin ? 

Still in the globe, ray attention turns wholly to it, for 
the globe-lense shows it distinctly enough to read its sur- 
face. Its mountains, valleys, and — yes, certainly, hu- 
man cities grow upon my vision. So interested am I, I 
forget to look for appurtenances or attachment fixtures, 
in my new custom of practical demonstration. 

As I get an important discovery of inventive construc- 
tion in a certain locality straight in my mind, it is almost 
knocked out, as now, directly over, I perceive a central 
light inside the satellite. It is a taper-kind and in dis- 
turbance. A burst of blackness drops from it and down 
toward me. Keenly alarmed, the tots are more so, as 
they, run and fall down and dig faces and hands beneath 
the boulder debris. 

As trembling thus they lay, I get another impress of 
them which suddenly takes definite form. The solution 
is present. The father and mother, before mysterious, 
are also present. What is quite astonishing, these two 
are one human being. Uncanny sense-gives way to de- 
light at the vision of strength and dignity, so masculine; 
enhanced by grace and tenderness, so feminine. 

I feel to clap my hands, but the inky blackness is com- 
ing down so fast I look to it. Wavering white spots are 
on it; reflections of the white cliffs below. ■ The forks of 
the rod are plain and take on a familiar contour. Con- 
tour of the Milky Way. Is that a mirage of this rod on 
night sky? 

The cloud falls and fells Savant too, nearly breaking 
the globe, as it splashes upon the nearest white cliff. 
The air now clears and cools as the deposit whitens, 
emitting a familiar odor. What! wax dropped out of 
the moon ? 

t The tots arise and fly with gauzy robes to the cliff- 
side and clamber excitedly about. Savant arises and 
enters the globe, proceeding to steer that way. 

As the moon takes a smiling adieu I turn my attention 
again to it. I hunt some before I find a faint line, far 
away attached to the earth-rim, obviously its fixture.

Simple but inexplicable in action. Though an electric 
connection in the rim may turn the earth-crust it would 
not also turn the moon, as the latter’s motion is monthly, 
not daily. 

Unable to solve this I complete my former broken dis- 
covery that the constructions on it are telescopes. Min- 
ing, maybe. Informing its people of the earth and how 
to get there. 

Approaching the cliff a digging is heard inside'. Then 
breaks out a waxen aperture, (closed by the splash) and 
out peeps a tiny head. We follow the rest, unseen, into 
the inner court of their mountain lodge. 

Wax-carved alcoves, cloud styles, line a large area 
open in the center thinly to the sky. In one a tiny 
table holds tiny plates of brittle make. In them, what? 
A giant mosquito trapped in the outer wax, its denuded 
wmgs wrapping the imp robbers. Another alcove in 
high cloud has a choir, lace draped and seated. I recol- 
lect the mist people. 

, In the center of the sward plaza, or esplanade, is a 
circular fountain, enclosing within its circular wall of 
water a dell or green glen. Covering our top, we steer 

rough the fountain side and to it. Discovering our- 
selves to the others, who scurry angrily behind us, we 
descend the dell, sloping down like a funnel, to find it 
s lortly cut off. But lower down —ground again. While 
gazing at the latter a sensation strangely affects me, that 
it is moving — moving slowly by. 

What is it? In the fixture— lubricated by the foun- 
f n VL eaC U vhlte Cliff (coolin 2 ‘he wax), moving as 

does the earth crust. We are both lost in study. 

The tmy fiends anger culminates, as altogether thev 
give the globe a sudden push. That taking Savant 
unawares, it is precipitated through the funnfl and to 
the moving ground below. Electric tremors shake us 
up, but, insulated, our globe survives, and passes on the 
ground motor out of sight of the enemies above A sto

gauze ribbon, up which goes the little gnome too fright- 
ened to fly. 

Breaking up the cake, I see in it a mould of the harle- 
quin form, which I proceed to restore and dress, to his 
consternation. My attention thus diverted sideways is 
attracted by the width of the cavern. The cause soon 
obvious. It contains other motor ground beds. The 
twin of this on which we lazily ride is close by, but 
moving in an opposite direction, like a band reaching 
out and returning. Does it contact with the earth crust, 
and turn it in daily curve? Then what do two others 
on each side of these, farther out, but opposite, also, and

I look around me, as I lay in my hammock on my

little porch. Directly in front of me is Saucy, a grown- 
up young lady, as genial and ingenuous as ever. 

“Now you are really awake, I will tell you what you 
have been doing while you were asleep. When I found 
you here and began slowly swinging yon, you sang out: 
“Give me a butterfly’s wing.” 

When I fanned you, you groaned, “Dost, lost, oh, the 
ice.” 

“Then Charley came.” (I see him, laughing behind a 
vine) ; “then talked gibberish to you, to see if you were 
asleep. You commenced making signs with your hands. 
Then slept soundly for a long time. 

“Getting restless you held to the hammock sides, as if 
you felt to be falling. 

“A branch of wistaria brushing your cheek, you ' 1 
grasped and began eating it. So I laid a banana on 
your hand, which you threw off as if it were a snake 
and bit you . 1 Bernard (the dog) licked your hand, when 
you fainted clear away. To restore you, we shook the 
hammock. You then made your feet go as in dancing, 
ending as in prayer. 

“Then you opened your eyes and looked straight ahead 
for a long time. Charley got a glass of water and 
sprinkled your face. Dropping the glass on the stand, 
you spoke in absorbed fashion, “Meteor,’ then awoke.’’ 


A dream! Only a dream! It was more— it was a 
grand inspiration. I will write it all down. 

The beautiful coach, with sail wings, the sea and ice 
tour. The city of Arc, city of Zion! The marvels of 
perpetual amusements, science and spiritism— of God (?). 

Going down the earth’s center— the awed terror. See- 
ing into the planets— I did, too, I know I did. 

I will write it all out. 

I have spoken aloud my dream, to two very intent 
M listeners, one of whom is convulsed anew. “A china

design is but in outline. We will some day catch a 
meteor, and go to inspect it closer.”
