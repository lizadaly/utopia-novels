# Unveiling a Parallel
## By Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant
### Published (1893)

  Originally published anonymously by ["Two Women of the
  West"](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/two_women_of_the_west),
  this satirical novel depicts two women-centered utopian societies: one
  with total economic and sexual freedom for women, the other chaste but
  communally-supportive. Alice Ilgenfritz Jones (1846-1906) published
  other novels in her lifetime, including an intersectional novel on
  race called [Beatrice of Bayou
  TÃªche](https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0679.htm); her writing partner
  Mary Ella Merchant (1857-1916) managed a large Cedar Rapids printing
  company and travelled extensively. See this article on [Unveiling a
  Parallel and Ella
