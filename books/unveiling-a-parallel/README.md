## By Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant
### Published (1893)

  Originally published anonymously by ["Two Women of the
  West"](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/two_women_of_the_west), this
  satirical novel depicts two women-centered utopian societies: one
  chaste, one with total economic and sexual freedom for women. Alice
  Ilgenfritz Jones (1846-1906) published other novels in her lifetime,
  including an intersectional novel on race called [Beatrice of Bayou
  TÃªche](https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0679.htm); her writing partner
  Ella Merchant (1857-1916) published no other works. See the [critical
  edition by Carol A.

  for an excellent biography of the authors and analysis of the story.
