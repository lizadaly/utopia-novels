        <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of the human mind is to
        forecast better things.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“We look before and after<br/> and pine for what is not.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This natural tendency to hope, desire, foresee and then, if
        possible, obtain, has been largely diverted from human
        usefulness since our goal was placed after death, in Heaven.
        With all our hope in “Another World,” we have largely lost hope
        of this one.</p>
        <p>Some minds, still keen in the perception of better human
        possibilities, have tried to write out their vision and give it
        to the world. From Plato’s ideal Republic to Wells’ Day of the
        Comet we have had many Utopias set before us, best known of
        which are that of Sir Thomas More and the great modern instance,
        “Looking Backward.”</p>
        <p>All these have one or two distinctive features—an element of
        extreme remoteness, or the introduction of some mysterious
        out-side force. “Moving the Mountain” is a short distance
        Utopia, a baby Utopia, a little one that can grow. It involves
        no other change than a change of mind, the mere awakening of
        people, especially the women, to existing possibilities. It
        indicates what people might do, real people, now living, in
        thirty years—if they would.</p>
        <p>One man, truly aroused and redirecting his energies, can
        change his whole life in thirty years.</p>
        <p>So can the world.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-1.">Chapter 1.</h1>
        <p>ON a gray, cold, soggy Tibetan plateau stood glaring at one
        another two white people—a man and a woman.</p>
        <p>With the first, a group of peasants; with the second, the
        guides and carriers of a well-equipped exploring party.</p>
        <p>The man wore the dress of a peasant, but around him was a
        leather belt—old, worn, battered—but a recognizable belt of no
        Asiatic pattern, and showing a heavy buckle made in twisted
        initials.</p>
        <p>The woman’s eye had caught the sunlight on this buckle before
        she saw that the heavily bearded face under the hood was white.
        She pressed forward to look at it.</p>
        <p>“Where did you get that belt?” she cried, turning for the
        interpreter to urge her question.</p>
        <p>The man had caught her voice, her words.</p>
        <p>He threw back his hood and looked at her, with a strange
        blank look, as of one listening to something far away.</p>
        <p>“John!” she cried. “John! My Brother!” He lifted a groping
        hand to his head, made a confused noise that ended in almost a
        shout of “Nellie!” reeled and fell backward.</p>
        <h3 id="section">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>When one loses his mind, as it were, for thirty years, and
        finds it again; when one wakes up; comes to life; recognizes
        oneself an American citizen twenty-five years old</p>
        <p>No. This is what I find it so hard to realize. I am not
        twenty-five; I am fifty-five.</p>
        <h3 id="section-1">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>Well, as I was saying, when one comes to life again like
        this, and has to renew acquaintance with one’s own mind, in a
        sudden swarming rush of hurrying memories—that is a good deal of
        pressure for a brain so long unused.</p>
        <p>But when on top of that, one is pushed headlong into a world
        immeasurably different from the world one has left at
        twenty-five—a topsy-turvy world, wherein all one’s most
        cherished ideals are found to be reversed, rearranged, or
        utterly gone; where strange new facts are accompanied by strange
        new thoughts and strange new feelings—the pressure becomes
        terrific,</p>
        <p>Nellie has suggested that I write it down, and I think for
        once she is right. I disagree with her on so many points that I
        am glad to recognize the wisdom of this idea. It will certainly
        be a useful process in my re-education; and relieve the mental
        tension.</p>
        <p>So, to begin with my first life, being now in my third</p>
        <h3 id="section-2">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>I am the only son of a Methodist minister of South Carolina.
        My mother was a Yankee. She died after my sister Ellen was born,
        when I was seven years old. My father educated me well. I was
        sent to a small Southern college, and showed such a talent for
        philology that I specialized in ancient languages, and, after
        some teaching and the taking of various degrees, I had a
        wonderful opportunity to join an expedition into India and
        Tibet. I was eager for a sight of those venerable races, those
        hoary scriptures, those time-honored customs. We were traveling
        through the Himalayas—and the last thing I remember was a night
        camp, and a six-months-old newspaper from home. We had
        rejoicingly obtained it from a party we met in the pass.</p>
        <p>It was read and re-read by all of us—even the
        advertisements—even the editorials, and in one of these I
        learned that Mrs. Eddy had been dead some time and that another
        religion had burst forth and was sweeping the country, madly
        taken up by the women. That was my last news item. I suppose it
        was this reading, and the discussions we had, that made me walk
        in my sleep that night. That is the only explanation I can give.
        I know I lay down just as I was—and that‘s all I know, until
        Nellie found me.</p>
        <p>The party reported me lost. They searched for days, made what
        inquiry they could. No faintest clue was ever found. Himalayan
        precipices are very tall, and very sudden. My sister Nellie was
        traveling in Tibet and found me, with a party of peasants. She
        gathered what she could from them, through interpreters. It
        seems that I fell among those people—literally; bruised,
        stunned, broken, but not dead. Some merciful—or shall I say
        unmerciful?—trees had softened the fall and let me down easy,
        comparatively speaking. They were good people—Buddhists. They
        mended my bones and cared for me, and it appears made me quite a
        chief man, in course of time, in their tiny village. But their
        little valley was so remote and unknown, so out of touch with
        any and everything, that no tale of this dumb white man ever
        reached Western ears. I was dumb until I learned their language,
        was “as a child of a day," they said—knew absolutely nothing.
        They taught me what they knew. I suppose I turned a prayer mill;
        I suppose I was married—Nellie didn‘t ask that, and they never
        mentioned such a detail. Furthermore, they gave so dim an
        account of where the place was that we don’t know now; should
        have to locate that night’s encampment, and then look for a
        precipice and go down it with ropes.</p>
        <p>As I have no longer any interest in those venerable races and
        time-honored customs, I think we will not do this.</p>
        <p>Well, she found me, and something happened. She says I knew
        her—shouted “Nellie!” and fell down—fell on a stone, too, and
        hit my head so hard they thought I was dead this time “for
        sure.” But when I “came to” I came all the way, back to where I
        was thirty years ago; and as for those thirty years—I do not
        remember one day of them.</p>
        <p>Nor do I wish to. I have those filthy Tibetan clothes,
        sterilized and packed away, but I never want to look at
        them.</p>
        <p>I am back in the real world, back where I was at twenty-five.
        But now I am fifty-five —</p>
        <h3 id="section-3">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>Now, about Nellie. I must go slowly and get this thing
        straightened out for good and all.</p>
        <p>My little sister! I was always fond of her, and she adored
        me. She looked up to me, naturally; believed everything I told
        her; minded me like a little dog—when she was a child. And as
        she grew into girl-hood, I had a strong restraining influence
        upon her. She wanted to be educated—to go to college—but father
        wouldn’t hear of it, of course, and I backed him up. If there is
        anything on earth I always hated and despised, it is a
        strong-minded woman! That is—it was. I certainly cannot hate and
        despise my sister Nellie.</p>
        <p>Now it appears that soon after my departure from this life
        father died, very suddenly. Nellie inherited the farm—and the
        farm turned out to be a mine, and the mine turned out to be
        worth a good deal of money.</p>
        <p>So that poor child, having no natural guardian or protector,
        just set to work for herself—went to college to her heart’s
        content, to a foreign university, too. She studied medicine,
        practiced a while, then was offered a chair in a college and
        took it; then—I hate to write it—but she is now president of a
        college—a coeducational college!</p>
        <p>“Don’t you mean ‘dean?’” I asked her.</p>
        <p>“No,” she said. “There is a dean of the girl’s building—but I
        am the president.”</p>
        <p>My little sister!</p>
        <h3 id="section-4">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>The worst of it is that my little sister is now forty-eight,
        and I— to all intents and purposes—am twenty-five! She is
        twenty-three years older than I am. She has had thirty years of
        world-life which I have missed entirely, and this thirty years,
        I begin to gather, has covered more changes than an ordinary
        century or two.</p>
        <p>It is lucky about that mine.</p>
        <p>“At least I shall not have to worry about money,” I said to
        her when she told me about our increased fortune.</p>
        <p>She gave one of those queer little smiles, as if she had
        something up her sleeve, and said:</p>
        <p>“No; you won’t have to worry in the about money.”</p>
        <p>Having all that medical skill of hers in the background, she
        took excellent care of me up there on those dreary plains and
        hills, brought me back to the coast by easy stages, and home on
        one of those new steamers—but I mustn’t stop to describe the
        details of each new thing I notice!</p>
        <p>I have sense enough myself, even if I’m not a doctor, to use
        my mind gradually, not to swallow too fast, as it were.</p>
        <p>Nellie is a little inclined to manage me. I don’t know as I
        blame her. I do feel like a child, sometimes. It is so
        humiliating not to know little common things such as everybody
        else knows. Air ships I expected, of course; they had started
        before I left. They are common enough, all sizes. But water is
        still the cheaper route—as well as slower.</p>
        <p>Nellie said she didn’t want me to get home too quick; she
        wanted time to explain things. So we spent long, quiet hours in
        our steamer chairs, talking things over.</p>
        <p>It’s no use asking about the family; there is only a flock of
        young cousins and “once removed” now; the aunts and uncles are
        mostly gone. Uncle Jake is left. Nellie grins wickedly when she
        mentions him.</p>
        <p>“If things get too hard on you, John, you can go down to
        Uncle Jake’s and rest up. He and Aunt Dorcas haven’t moved an
        inch. They fairly barricade their minds against a new idea—and
        he ploughs and she cooks up on that little mountain farm just as
        they always did. People go to see them”</p>
        <p>“Why shouldn’t they?” I asked. And she smiled that queer
        little smile again.</p>
        <p>“I mean they go to see them as if they were the
        Pyramids.”</p>
        <p>“I see,” said I. “I might as well prepare for some
        preposterous nightmare of a world, like—what was that book of
        Wells’, ‘The Sleeper Awakened?’”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes; I remember that book,” she answered, “and a lot of
        others. People were already guessing about things as they might
        be, weren’t they? But what never struck any of them was that the
        people themselves could change.”</p>
        <p>“No,” I agreed. “You can’t alter human nature.”</p>
        <p>Nellie laughed—laughed out loud. Then she squeezed my hand
        and patted it.</p>
        <p>“You Dear!” she said. “You precious old Long–Lost Brother!
        When you get too utterly upset I’ll wear my hair down, put on a
        short dress and let you boss me awhile—to keep your spirits up.
        That was just the phrase, wasn’t it?—‘You can’t alter human
        nature!’” And she laughed again.</p>
        <p>There is something queer about Nellie—very queer. It is not
        only that she is different from my little sister—that’s natural;
        but she is different from any woman of forty-eight I ever
        saw—from any woman of any age I ever saw.</p>
        <p>In the first place, she doesn’t look old—not at all. Women of
        forty, in our region, were old women, and Nellie’s near fifty!
        Then she isn’t—what shall I call it—dependent; not the least in
        the world. As soon as I became really conscious, and strong
        enough to be of any use, and began to offer her those little
        services and attentions due to a woman, I noticed this
        difference.</p>
        <p>She is brisk, firm, assured—not unpleasantly so; I don’t mean
        a thing of that sort; but somehow like—almost like a man! No, I
        certainly don’t mean that. She is not in the least mannish, nor
        in the least self-assertive; but she takes things so easily—as
        if she owned them.</p>
        <p>I suppose it will be some time before my head is absolutely
        clear and strong as it used to be. I tire rather easily. Nellie
        is very reassuring about it. She says it will take about a year
        to re-establish connections and renew mental processes. She
        advises me to read and talk only a little every day, to sleep
        all I can, and not to worry.</p>
        <p>“You’ll be all right soon, my dear,” she says, “and plenty of
        life before you. You seem to have led a very healthy out-door
        life. You’re really well and strong—and as good-looking as
        ever.”</p>
        <p>At least she hasn’t forgotten that woman’s chief duty is to
        please.</p>
        <p>“And the world is a much better place to be in than it was,”
        she assured me. “Things will surprise you, of course—things I
        have gotten used to and shall forget to tell you about. But the
        changes are all good ones, and you’ll soon get—acclimated.
        You’re young yet.”</p>
        <p>That’s where Nellie slips up. She cannot help having me in
        mind as the brave young brother she knew. She forgets that I am
        an old man now. Finally I told her that.</p>
        <p>“No, John Robertson,” she she, “that’s where you are utterly
        wrong. Of course, you don’t know what we’re doing about age—how
        differently we feel. As a matter of physiology we find that
        about one hundred and fifty ought to be our natural limit; and
        that with proper conditions we can easily get to be a hundred
        now. Ever so many do.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t want to be a hundred,” I protested. “I saw a man of
        ninety-eight once, and never want to be one.”</p>
        <p>“It’s not like that now,” she said. “I mean we live to be a
        hundred and enjoy life still—‘keep our faculties,’ as they used
        to put it. Why, the ship’s doctor here is eighty-seven.”</p>
        <p>This surprised me a good deal. I had talked a little with
        this man, and had thought him about sixty.</p>
        <p>“Then a man of a hundred, according to your story, would look
        like—like——”</p>
        <p>“Like Grandpa Ely,” she offered.</p>
        <p>I remembered my mother’s father—a tall, straight, hale old
        man of seventy-five. He had a clear eye, a firm step, a rosy
        color in his face. Well, that wasn’t so bad a prospect.</p>
        <p>“I consent to be a hundred—on those terms,” I told her.</p>
        <h3 id="section-5">. . . . .</h3>
        <p>She talked to me a good bit, in small daily doses, of the
        more general changes in the world, showed me new maps, even let
        me read a little in the current magazines.</p>
        <p>“I suppose you have a million of these now,” I said. “There
        were thousands when I left!”</p>
        <p>“No,” she answered. “There are fewer, I believe; but much
        better.”</p>
        <p>I turned over the one in my hand. It was pleasantly light and
        thin, it opened easily, the paper and presswork were of the
        best, the price was twenty-five cents.</p>
        <p>“Is this a cheap one—at a higher price? or have the best ones
        come down?”</p>
        <p>“It’s a cheap one,” she told me, “if you mean by that a
        popular one, and it’s cheap enough. They have all of a million
        subscribers.”</p>
        <p>“And what’s the difference, beyond the paper and print?” I
        asked.</p>
        <p>“The pictures are good.”</p>
        <p>I looked it through again.</p>
        <p>“Yes, very good, much improved. But I don’t see anything
        phenomenal—unless it is the absence of advertisements.”</p>
        <p>Nellie took it out of my hand and ran it over.</p>
        <p>“Just read some of that,” she said. “Read this story—and this
        article—and that.”</p>
        <p>So I sat reading in the sunny silence, the gulls wheeling and
        dipping just as they used to, and the wide purple ocean just as
        changeable—and changeless—as ever.</p>
        <p>One of the articles was on an extension of municipal service,
        and involved so much comment on preceding steps that I found it
        most enlightening. The other was a recent suggestion in
        educational psychology, and this too carried a retrospect of
        recent progress which gave me food for thought. The story was a
        clever one. I found it really amusing, and only on a second
        reading did I find what it was that gave the queer flavor to it.
        It was a story about women—two women who were in business
        partnership, with their adventures, singly and together.</p>
        <p>I looked through it carefully. They were not even girls, they
        were not handsome, they were not in process of being married—in
        fact, it was not once mentioned whether they were married or
        not, ever had been or ever wanted to be. Yet I had found it
        amusing!</p>
        <p>I laid the magazine on my rug-bound knees and meditated. A
        queer sick feeling came over me—mental, not physical. I looked
        through the magazine again. It was not what I should have called
        “a woman’s magazine,” yet the editor was a woman, most of the
        contributors were women, and in all the subject matter I began
        to detect allusions and references of tremendous import.</p>
        <p>Presently Nellie came to see how I was getting on. I saw her
        approaching, a firm, brisk figure, well and becomingly dressed,
        with a tailored trimness and convenience, far indeed from the
        slim, graceful, yielding girl I had once been so proud to
        protect and teach.</p>
        <p>“How soon do we get in, Lady Manager?” I asked her.</p>
        <p>“Day after tomorrow,” she answered back promptly—not a word
        about going to see, or asking anyone!</p>
        <p>“Well, ma’am, I want you to sit down here and tell me
        things—right now. What am I to expect? Are there no men left in
        America?”</p>
        <p>She laughed gaily.</p>
        <p>“No men! Why, bless you, there are as many men as there are
        women, and a few more, I believe. Not such an over-plus as there
        used to be, but some to spare still. We had a million and a half
        extra in your day, you know.”</p>
        <p>“I’m glad to learn we’re allowed to live!” said I. “Now tell
        me the worst—are the men all doing the housework?”</p>
        <p>“You call that ‘the worst,’ do you?” inquired Nellie, cocking
        her head to one side and looking at me affectionately, and yet
        quizzically. “Well, I guess it was—pretty near ‘the worst!’ No
        dear, men are doing just as many kinds of business as they ever
        were.”</p>
        <p>I heaved a sigh of relief and chucked my magazine under the
        chair.</p>
        <p>“I’d begun to think there weren’t any men left. And they
        still wear trousers, don’t they?”</p>
        <p>She laughed outright.</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes. They wear just as many trousers as they did
        before.”</p>
        <p>“And what do the women wear,” I demanded suspiciously.</p>
        <p>“Whatever kind of clothing their work demands,” she
        answered.</p>
        <p>“Their work? What kind of work do they do?”</p>
        <p>“All kinds—anything they like.”</p>
        <p>I groaned and shut my eyes. I could see the world as I left
        it, with only a small proportion of malcontents and a large
        majority of contented and happy homes; and then I saw this awful
        place I was coming to, with strange, masculine women and subdued
        men.</p>
        <p>“How does it happen that there aren’t any on this ship?” I
        inquired.</p>
        <p>“Any what?” asked Nellie.</p>
        <p>“Any of these—New Women?”</p>
        <p>“Why, there are. They’re all new, except Mrs. Talbot. She’s
        older than I am, and rather reactionary.”</p>
        <p>This Mrs. Talbot was a stiff, pious, narrow-minded old lady,
        and I had liked her the least of any on board.</p>
        <p>“Do you mean to tell me that pretty Mrs. Exeter is—one of
        this new kind?”</p>
        <p>“Mrs. Exeter owns—and manages—a large store, if that is what
        you mean.”</p>
        <p>“And those pretty Borden girls?”</p>
        <p>“They do house decorating—have been abroad on business.”</p>
        <p>“And Mrs. Green—and Miss Sandwich?”</p>
        <p>“One of them is a hat designer, one a teacher. This is toward
        the end of vacation, and they’re all coming home, you see.”</p>
        <p>“And Miss Elwell?”</p>
        <p>Miss Elwell was quite the prettiest woman on board, and
        seemed to have plenty of attention—just like the girls I
        remembered.</p>
        <p>“Miss Elwell is a civil engineer,” said my sister.</p>
        <p>“It’s horrid,” I said. “It’s perfectly horrid! And aren’t
        there any women left?”</p>
        <p>“There’s Aunt Dorcas,” said Nellie, mischievously, “and
        Cousin Drusilla. You remember Drusilla?”</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-2.">Chapter 2.</h1>
        <p>THE day after tomorrow! I was to see it the day after
        tomorrow—this strange, new, abhorrent world!</p>
        <p>The more I considered what bits of information I had gleaned
        already, the more I disliked what lay before me. In the first
        blazing light of returned memory and knowledge, the first joy of
        meeting my sister, the hope of seeing home again, I had not
        distinguished very sharply between what was new to my bewildered
        condition and what was new indeed—new to the world as well as to
        me. But now a queer feeling of disproportion and unreality began
        to haunt me.</p>
        <p>As my head cleared, and such knowledge as I was now gathering
        began to help towards some sense of perspective and relation,
        even my immediate surroundings began to assume a sinister
        importance.</p>
        <p>Any change, to any person, is something of a shock, though
        sometimes a beneficial one. Changes too sudden, and too great,
        are hard to bear, for any one. But who can understand the
        peculiar horror of my unparalleled experience?</p>
        <p>Slowly the thing took shape in my mind.</p>
        <p>There was the first, irrevocable loss—my life!</p>
        <p>Thirty years—the thirty years in which a man may really
        live—these were gone from me forever.</p>
        <p>I was coming back; strong to be sure; well enough in health;
        even, I hoped, with my old mental vigor—but not to the same
        world.</p>
        <p>Even the convict who survives thirty years imprisonment, may
        return at length to the same kind of world he had left so
        long.</p>
        <p>But I! It was as if I had slept, and, in my sleep, they had
        stolen my world.</p>
        <p>I threw off the thought, and started in to action.</p>
        <p>Here was a small world—the big steamer beneath me. I had
        already learned much about her. In the first place, she was not
        a</p>
        <p>“steamer,” but a thing for which I had no name; her power was
        electric,</p>
        <p>“Oh, well,” I thought, as I examined her machinery, “this I
        might have expected. Thirty years of such advances as we were
        making in 1910 were sure to develop electric motors of all
        sorts.”</p>
        <p>The engineer was a pleasant, gentlemanly fellow, more than
        willing to talk about his profession and its marvellous
        advances. The ship was well manned, certainly; though the work
        required was far less than it used to be, the crew were about as
        numerous. I had made some acquaintances among the ship’s
        officers—even among the men, who were astonishingly civil and
        well-mannered—but I had not at first noticed the many points of
        novelty in their attitude or in my surroundings.</p>
        <p>Now I paced the deck and considered the facts I had
        observed—the perfect ventilation of the vessel, the absence of
        the smell of cooking and of bilge water, the dainty convenience
        and appropriate beauty of all the fittings and furnishings, the
        smooth speed and steadiness of her,</p>
        <p>The quarters of the crew I found as remarkable as anything
        else about the vessel; indeed the forecastle and steerage
        differed more from what I remembered than from any other part.
        Every person on board had a clean and comfortable lodging,
        though there were grades of distinction in size and decoration.
        But any gentleman could have lived in that “foks’le” without
        discomfort. Indeed, I soon found that many gentlemen did. I
        discovered, quite by accident, that one of the crew was a
        Harvard man. He was not at all loath to talk of it, either—was
        evidently no black sheep of any sort.</p>
        <p>Why had he chosen this work?</p>
        <p>Oh, he wanted the experience—it widened life, knowing
        different trades.</p>
        <p>Why was he not an officer then?</p>
        <p>He didn’t care to work at it long enough—this was only
        experience work, you see.</p>
        <p>I did not see, nor ask, but I inferred, and it gave me again
        that feeling as if the ground underfoot had wiggled
        slightly.</p>
        <p>Was that old dream of Bellamy’s stalking abroad? Were young
        men portioned out to menial service, willy-nilly?</p>
        <p>It was evidently not a universal custom, for some of the
        sailors were much older men, and long used to the business. I
        got hold of one who seemed more like the deckhands of old days,
        though cleaner and more cheerful; a man who was all of
        sixty.</p>
        <p>Yes he had followed the sea from boyhood. Yes, he liked it,
        always had liked it, liked it better now than when he was
        young.</p>
        <p>He had seen many changes? I listened carefully, though I
        asked the question lightly enough.</p>
        <p>Changes! He guessed he had. Terbacca was better for one
        thing—I was relieved to see that men still smoked, and then the
        jar came again as I remembered that save for this man, and one
        elderly officer, I had not seen anyone smoking on the
        vessel.</p>
        <p>“How do you account for it?” I asked the old Yankee. “For
        tobacco’s being better?”</p>
        <p>He grinned cheerfully.</p>
        <p>“Less run on it, I guess,” said he. “Young fellers don’t seem
        to smoke no more, and I ain’t seen nobody chewing for—well, for
        ten years back,”</p>
        <p>“Is it cheaper as well as better?”</p>
        <p>“No, sir, it ain’t. It’s perishing high. But then, wages is
        high, too,” he grudgingly admitted.</p>
        <p>“Better tobacco and better wages—anything else improved?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir-ee! Grub’s better, by square miles—and
        ‘commodations—an’ close. Make better stuff now.”</p>
        <p>“Well! well!” said I as genially as I knew how. “That’s very
        different from my young days. Then everybody older than I always
        complained about all manner of things, and told how much
        better—and cheaper—things were when they were young.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, ’twas so,” he admitted meditatively. “But ‘tain’t so
        now. Shoes is better, most things is better, I guess. Seems like
        water runnin’ up hill, don’t it, sir?”</p>
        <p>It did. I didn’t like it. I got away from the old man, and
        walked by myself—like Kipling’s cat.</p>
        <p>“Of course, of course!” I said to myself impatiently, “I may
        as well expect to find everything as much improved from what it
        was in my time as in, say, sixty years before.</p>
        <p>That sort of progress goes faster and faster. Things change,
        but people—”</p>
        <p>And here is where I got this creepy sense of unreality.</p>
        <p>At first everything was so strange to me, and my sister was
        so kind and thoughtful, so exquisitely considerate of my
        feelings and condition, that I had failed to notice this
        remarkable circumstance—so were the other people. It was like
        being in a—well, in a house-party of very nice persons. Kind,
        cheerful, polite—here I suddenly realized that I had not seen a
        grouchy face, heard an unkind remark, felt, as one does feel
        through silk and broadcloth, the sense of discontent and
        disapproval.</p>
        <p>There was one, the somewhat hard-faced old lady, Mrs. Talbot,
        of whom I had hopes. I sought her, and laid myself out to please
        her by those little attentions which are so grateful to an
        elderly woman from a young man.</p>
        <p>Her accepting these as a commonplace, her somewhat too
        specific inquiries about my health, suddenly reminded me that I
        was not a young man.</p>
        <p>She talked on while I made again that effort at readjustment
        which was so hideously hard. Gone in a night—all my young
        manhood—gone untasted!</p>
        <p>“Do you find it difficult to concentrate your attention?” she
        was saying, a steely eye fixed upon my face.</p>
        <p>“I beg your pardon, madam. I fear I do. You were saying—”</p>
        <p>“I was saying that you will find many changes when you get
        back.”</p>
        <p>“I find them already, Mrs. Talbot. They rather loom up. It is
        sudden, you see.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, you’ve been away a long time, I understand. In the far
        East?”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Talbot was the first person who had asked me a question.
        Evidently hers were the manners of an older generation, and for
        once I had to admit that the younger generation had
        improved.</p>
        <p>But I recalled the old defensive armor against the old
        assaults.</p>
        <p>“Quite a while,” I answered cheerfully, “Quite a while. Now
        what should you think would impress me most—in the way of
        change?” it</p>
        <p>“The women,” she answered promptly.</p>
        <p>I smiled my gallantest, and replied, bowing:</p>
        <p>“I find them still charming.”</p>
        <p>Her set face broke into a pleased smile.</p>
        <p>“You do my heart good!” she cried. “I haven’t heard a
        compliment in fifteen years.”</p>
        <p>“Good Heavens, madam! what are our men thinking of?”</p>
        <p>“It’s not the men’s fault; it’s the women’s. They won’t have
        it.”</p>
        <p>“Are there many of these—new women?”</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing else—except a few old ones like me.”</p>
        <p>I hastened to assure her that a woman like her would never be
        called old—and she looked as pleased as a girl.</p>
        <p>Presently I excused myself and left her, with relief. It was
        annoying beyond measure to have the only specimen of the kind of
        woman I used to like turn out to be personally the kind I never
        liked.</p>
        <p>On the opposite deck, I found Miss Elwell—and for once alone.
        A retiring back, wearing an aggrieved expression showed that it
        had not been for long.</p>
        <p>“May I join you, Miss Elwell?”</p>
        <p>I might. I did. We paced up and down, silent for a bit.</p>
        <p>She was a joy to the eye, a lovely, straight, young thing,
        with a fresh, pure color and eyes of dancing brightness. I spoke
        of this and that aboard ship—the sea, the weather; and she was
        so gaily friendly, so sweet and modest, yet wholly frank, that I
        grew quite happy in her company.</p>
        <p>My sister must have been mistaken about her being a civil
        engineer. She might be a college girl—but nothing worse. And she
        was so pretty!</p>
        <p>I devoted myself to Miss Elwell ’till she took herself off,
        probably to join her—her—it occurred to me that I had seen no
        one with Miss Elwell.</p>
        <p>“Nellie” said I, “for heaven’s sake give me the straight of
        all this. I’m going distracted with the confusion. What has
        happened to the world? Tell me all, I can bear it—as the extinct
        novels used to say. But I cannot bear this terrible suspense!
        Don’t you have novels any more?”</p>
        <p>“Novels? Oh, yes, plenty; better than ever were written.
        You’ll find it splendidly worth while to read quite a few of
        them while you’re getting oriented . . . Well, you want a kind
        of running, historic sketch?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. Give me the outlines—just the heads, as it were. You
        see, my dear, it is not easy to get readjusted even to the old
        things, and there are so many new ones”</p>
        <p>We were in our steamer chairs, most people dozing after their
        midday meal. She reached over and took my hand in hers, and held
        it tight. It was marvelously comforting, this one live visible
        link between what was forever past and this uncertain future.
        But for her, even those old, old days might have flickered and
        seemed doubtful—I should have felt like one swimming under water
        and not knowing, which way was up. She gave me solid ground
        underfoot at any rate. Whatever her place might be in this New
        World, she had talked to me only of the old one.</p>
        <p>In these long, quiet, restful days, she had revived in my
        mind the pleasant memories of our childhood together; our little
        Southern home; our patient, restrained Northern mother and the
        fine education she gave her school-less little ones; our
        high-minded—and, alas, narrow-minded—father, handsome,
        courteous, inflexible. Under Nellie’s gentle leading, my long
        unused memory-cells had revived like rain-washed leaves, and my
        past life had, at last, grown clear and steady.</p>
        <p>My college life; my old chum, Granger, who had visited us
        once; our neighbors and relations; little gold-haired Cousin
        Drusilla, whom I, in ten years proud seniority, had teased as a
        baby, played with and tyrannized over as a confiding child, and
        kissed good-bye—a slim, startled little figure—when I left for
        Asia.</p>
        <p>Nellie had always spoken of things as I remembered them, and
        avoided adroitly, or quietly refused to discuss, their new
        aspects.</p>
        <p>I think she was right—at first.</p>
        <p>“Out with it!” said I. “Come—Have we adopted Socialism?” I
        braced myself for the answer.</p>
        <p>“Socialism? Oh—why, yes. I think we did. But that was twenty
        years ago.”</p>
        <p>“And it didn’t last? You’ve proved the impracticable folly of
        it? You‘ve discarded it?”</p>
        <p>I sat up straight, very eager.</p>
        <p>“Why, no—” said Nellie. “It’s very hard to put these new
        things into old words—We’ve got beyond it.”</p>
        <p>“Beyond Socialism! Not—not—Anarchy?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, bless you, no; no indeed! We understand better what
        socialism meant, that’s all. We have more, much more, than it
        ever asked; but we don’t call it that.”</p>
        <p>I did not understand.</p>
        <p>“It’s like this,” she said. “Suppose you had left a friend in
        the throes of a long, tempestuous’ courtship, full of ardor, of
        keen joy, and keener anticipation. Then, returning, you say to
        your friend, ‘Do you still have courtship?’ And he says, ‘Why
        no, I’m married.’ It’s not that he has discarded it, proved it’s
        impracticable folly. He had to have it—he liked it—but he’s got
        beyond it.”</p>
        <p>“Go on and elucidate,” I said. “I don’t quite follow your
        parable.”</p>
        <p>She considered a bit.</p>
        <p>“Well, here’s a more direct parallel. Back in the 18th
        century, the world was wild about Democracy—Democracy was going
        to do all things for all men. Then, with prodigious struggles,
        they acquired some Democracy—set it going. It was a good thing.
        But it took time. It grew. It had difficulties. In the next
        century, there was less talk about all the heavenly results of
        Democracy, and more definite efforts to make it work.”</p>
        <p>This was clearer.</p>
        <p>“You mean,” I followed her slowly.</p>
        <p>“That what was called socialism was attained—and you’ve been
        improving upon it?”</p>
        <p>“Exactly, Brother, ‘you are on’—as we used to say. But even
        that’s not the main step.”</p>
        <p>“No? What else?”</p>
        <p>“Only a New Religion.”</p>
        <p>I showed my disappointment. Nellie watched my face silently.
        She laughed. She even kissed me.</p>
        <p>“John” said she, “I could make vast sums by exhibiting you to
        psychologists! as An Extinct Species of Mind. You’d draw better
        than a Woolly Mammoth.”</p>
        <p>I smiled wryly; and she squeezed my hand. “Might as well make
        a joke of it, Old Man—you’ve got to get used to it, and ‘the
        sooner the quicker!’”</p>
        <p>“All right—Go ahead with your New Religion.”</p>
        <p>She sat back in her chair with an expression of amused
        retrospection.</p>
        <p>“I had forgotten,” she said, “I had really forgotten. We
        didn’t use to think much of religion, did we?”</p>
        <p>“Father did,” said I.</p>
        <p>“No, not even Father and his kind—they only used it as a—what
        was the old joke? a patent fire escape! Nobody appreciated
        Religion!”</p>
        <p>“They spent much time and money on it,” I suggested.</p>
        <p>“That’s not appreciation!”</p>
        <p>“Well, come on with the story. Did you have another
        Incarnation of any body?”</p>
        <p>“You might call it that,” Nellie allowed, her voice growing
        quietly earnest, “We certainly had somebody with an unmistakable
        Power.”</p>
        <p>This did not interest me at all. I hated to see Nellie
        looking so sweetly solemn over her “New Religion,” In the not
        unnatural reaction of a minister’s son, rigidly reared, I had
        had small use for religion of any sort. As a scholar I had
        studied them all, and felt as little reverence for the ancient
        ones as for the shifty mushroom crop of new sects and schools of
        thought with which the country teemed in my time.</p>
        <p>“Now, look here, John,” said she at length, “I’ve been
        watching you pretty closely and I think you’re equal to a
        considerable mental effort—In one way, it may be easier for you,
        just because you’ve not seen a bit of it—anyhow, you’ve got to
        face it. Our world has changed in these thirty years, more than
        the change between what it used to be and what people used to
        imagine about Heaven. Here is the first thing you’ve got to
        do—mentally. You must understand, clearly, in your human
        consciousness, that the objection and distaste you feel is only
        in your personal consciousness. Everything is better; there is
        far more comfort, pleasure, peace of mind; a richer swifter
        growth, a higher happier life in every way; and yet, you won’t
        like it because your—” she seemed to hesitate for a word, now
        and then; as one trying to translate, “reactions are all tuned
        to earlier con ditions. If you can understand this and see over
        your own personal—attitudes it will not be long before a real
        convincing sense of joy, of life, will follow the intellectual
        perception that things are better.”</p>
        <p>“Hold on,” I said, “Let me chew on that a little.”</p>
        <p>“As if,” I presently suggested, “as if I’d left a home that
        was poor and dirty and crowded, with a pair of quarrelsome
        inefficient parents—drunken and abusive, maybe, and a lot of
        horrid, wrangling, selfish, little brothers and sisters—and woke
        up one fine morning in a great clean beautiful house—richly
        furnished—full of a lot of angels—who were total strangers?”</p>
        <p>“Exactly!” she cried. “Hurrah for you, Johnnie, you couldn’t
        have defined it better.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t like it,” said I. “I’d rather have my old home and
        my own family than all the princely palaces and amiable angels
        you could dream of in a hundred years.”</p>
        <p>“Mother had an old story-book by a New England author,”
        Nellie quietly remarked, “where somebody said, ‘You can’t always
        have your “druthers”’—she used to quote it to me when I was
        little and complained that things were not as I wanted them.
        John, dear, please remember that the new people in the new world
        find it ‘like home’ and love it far better than we used to.
        It’ll be queer to you, but it’s a pleasant commonplace to them.
        We have found out at last that it is natural to be happy.”</p>
        <p>She was silent and I was silent; till I asked her “What’s the
        name of your new religion?”</p>
        <p>“It hasn’t any,” she answered.</p>
        <p>“Hasn’t any? What do they call it? the Believers, I
        mean?”</p>
        <p>“They call it ‘Living’ and ‘Life’—that’s all.”</p>
        <p>“Hm! and what’s their specialty?”</p>
        <p>Nellie gave a funny little laugh, part sad, part tender, part
        amused.</p>
        <p>“I had no idea it would be so hard to tell you things,” she
        said. “You’ll have to just see for yourself, I guess.”</p>
        <p>“Do go on, Nellie. I’ll be good. You were going to tell me,
        in a nutshell, what had happened—please do.”</p>
        <p>“The thing that has happened,” said she, slowly, “is just
        this. The world has come alive. We are doing in a pleasant,
        practical way, all the things which we could have done, at any
        time before—only we never thought so. The real change is this:
        we have changed our minds. This happened very soon after you
        left. Ah! that was a time! To think that you should have missed
        it!” She gave my hand another sympathetic squeeze and went on.
        “After that it was only a question of time, of how soon we could
        do things. And we’ve been doing them ever since, faster and
        faster.”</p>
        <p>This seemed rather flat and disappointing.</p>
        <p>“I don’t see that you make out anything wonderful—so far. A
        new Religion which seems to consist only in behaving better; and
        a gradual improvement of social conditions—all that was going on
        when I left.”</p>
        <p>Nellie regarded me with a considering eye.</p>
        <p>“I see how you interpret it,” she said, “behaving better in
        our early days was a small personal affair; either a
        pathetically inadequate failure to do what one could not, or a
        pharisaic, self-righteous success in doing what one could. All
        personal—personal!”</p>
        <p>“Good behavior has to be a personal affair, hasn’t it?” I
        mildly protested.</p>
        <p>“Not by any means!” said Nellie with decision. “That was
        precisely what kept us so small and bad, so miserably confined
        and discouraged. Like a lot of well-meaning soldiers imagining
        that their evolutions were ‘a personal affair’—or an orchestra
        plaintively protesting that if each man played a correct tune of
        his own choosing, the result would be perfect! Dear! dear! No,
        Sir” she continued with some fierceness, “that’s just where we
        changed our minds! Humanity has come alive, I tell you and we
        have reason to be proud of our race!”</p>
        <p>She held her head high, there was a glad triumphant look in
        her eyes—not in the least religious. Said she: “You’ll see
        results. That will make it clearer to you than anything I can
        say. But if I may remark that we have no longer the fear of
        death—much less of damnation, and no such thing as ‘sin’; that
        the only kind of prison left is called a quarantine—that
        punishment is unknown but preventive means are of a drastic and
        sweeping nature such as we never dared think of before—that
        there is no such thing in the civilized world as poverty—no
        labor problem—no color problem—no sex problem—almost no
        disease—very little accident—practically no fires—that the world
        is rapidly being reforested—the soil improved; the output
        growing in quantity and quality; that no one needs to work over
        two hours a day and most people work four—that we have no
        graft—no adulteration of goods—no malpractice—no crime.”</p>
        <p>“Nellie,” said I, “you are a woman and my sister. I’m very
        sorry, but I don’t believe it.”</p>
        <p>“I thought you wouldn’t,” said she. Women always will have
        the last word.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>THE blue shore line of one’s own land always brings a thrill
        of the heart; to me, buried exile as I had been, the heart-leap
        was choking.</p>
        <p>Ours was a slow steamer, and we did not stop at Montauk where
        the mail and the swiftest travelers landed, nor in Jamaica
        Harbor with the immigrants.</p>
        <p>As we swept along the sunny, level spaces of the South shore,
        Nellie told me how Long Island was now the “Reception Room” of
        our country, instead of poor, brutal little Ellis Island.</p>
        <p>“The shores are still mostly summer places,” she said. “One
        of the most convincing of our early lines of advance was started
        on the South shore; and there are plenty of Country Clubs, Home
        Parks and things like that; but the bulk of the island toward
        the western end is an experiment station in applied
        sociology.</p>
        <p>I was watching the bright shore hungrily. With a glass I
        could see many large buildings, not too closely set.</p>
        <p>“I should think it would spoil the place for homes,” I
        said.</p>
        <p>Nellie had a way of listening to my remarks, kindly and
        pleasantly, but as if I were somehow a long way off and she was
        trying to grasp what I said.</p>
        <p>“In a way it did—at first;” she explained presently, “but
        even then it meant just as many homes for other people, and now
        it means so much more!”</p>
        <p>She hesitated a moment and then plunged in resolutely.</p>
        <p>“You’re in for a steady course of instructive remarks from
        now on. Everybody will be explaining things and bragging about
        them. We haven’t outgrown some of the smaller vices, you see. As
        to this ‘Immigration Problem’—we woke up to this fact among
        others, that the ‘reintegration of peoples’ as Ward called it,
        was a sociological process not possible to stop, but quite
        possible to assist and to guide to great advantage. And here in
        America we recognized our own special place—‘the melting pot’
        you know?”</p>
        <p>Yes, I remembered the phrase, I never liked it. Our family
        were pure English stock, and rightly proud of their descent.</p>
        <p>“I begin to see, my dear sister, that while receiving the
        torrent of instructive remarks you foretell, the way of wisdom
        for me is steadfastly to withhold my own opinions.”</p>
        <p>Nellie laughed appreciatively.</p>
        <p>“You always had a long head, John. Well, whether you like it
        or not, our people saw their place and power at last and rose to
        it. We refuse no one. We have discovered as many ways of
        utilizing human waste as we used to have for the waste products
        of coal tar.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t mean to say idiots and criminals?” I
        protested.</p>
        <p>“Idiots, hopeless ones, we don’t keep any more,” she answered
        gently. “They are very rare now. The grade of average humanity
        is steadily rising; and we have the proud satisfaction of
        knowing we have helped it rise. We organized a permanent
        ‘reception committee’ for the whole country, one station here
        and one in California. Anybody could come—but they had to submit
        to our handling when they did come.”</p>
        <p>“We used to have physical examination, didn’t we?”</p>
        <p>“A rudimentary one. What we have now is Compulsory
        Socialization.”</p>
        <p>I stared at her.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I know! You are thinking of that geological kind of
        evolution people used to talk about, and ‘you can’t alter human
        nature.’ In the first place, we can. In the second place, we do.
        In the third place, there isn’t so much alteration needed as we
        used to think. Human nature is a pretty good thing. No immigrant
        is turned loose on the community till he or she is up to a
        certain standard, and the children we educate.”</p>
        <p>“We always did, didn’t we?”</p>
        <p>“Always did? Why brother, we didn’t know what the word meant
        in your time.”</p>
        <p>“I shall be glad to follow that up,” I assured her.
        “Education was improving even in the old days, I remember. I
        shall be glad to see the schools.”</p>
        <p>“Some of them you won’t know when you do see them,” said
        Nellie. “On Long Island we have agricultural and industrial
        stations like—like—I think we had something like it in some of
        our Western colleges, which it was the fashion to look down
        upon. We have a graded series of dwellings where the use of
        modern conveniences is taught to all newcomers.”</p>
        <p>“Suppose they won’t learn? They used to prefer to live like
        hogs, as I remember.”</p>
        <p>Again Nellie looked at me as if I were speaking to her from a
        distance.</p>
        <p>“We used to say so—and I suppose we used to think so—some of
        us. But we know better now. These people are not compelled to
        come to our country, but if they come they know what they have
        to do—and they do it. You may have noticed that we have no
        ‘steerage’.”</p>
        <p>I had noticed it.</p>
        <p>“They have decent surroundings from the first step. They have
        to be antiseptically clean, they and all their belongings,
        before entering the ship.”</p>
        <p>“But what an awful expense!” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“Suppose you keep cattle, John, and knew how to fatten and
        improve them; and suppose your ranch was surrounded by
        strays—mavericks—anxious to come in. Would you call it ‘an
        expense’ to add to your herd?”</p>
        <p>“You can’t sell people.”</p>
        <p>“No, but you can profit by their labor.”</p>
        <p>“That sounds like the same old game. I should think your
        Socialism would have put an end to that.”</p>
        <p>“Socialism did not alter the fact that wealth comes by
        labor,” she replied. “All these people work. We provide the
        opportunity for them, we train them to higher efficiency,
        especially the children. The very best and wisest of us are
        proud to serve there—as women used to be proud when they were
        invited ‘to help receive’ some personage. We receive
        Humanity—and introduce it to America. What they produce is used
        to cover the expense of their training, and also to lay up a
        surplus for themselves.”</p>
        <p>“They must produce more than they used to,” observed I
        drily.</p>
        <p>“They do,” said Nellie.</p>
        <p>“You might as well finish this thing up,” I said. “Then when
        people talk to me about immigration, I can look intelligent and
        say, ‘I know about that.’ And really, I’m interested. How do you
        begin with ’em?”</p>
        <p>“When they come into Jamaica Harbor they see a great crescent
        of white piers, each with its gate. We’ll go and see it some
        day—splendid arches with figures on them, like the ones they
        used to put up for Triumphs. There’s the German Gate and the
        Spanish Gate, the English Gate, the Italian Gate—and so on.
        There is welcome in their own language—and instruction in ours.
        There is physical examination—the most searching and
        thorough—microscopic—chemical. They have to come up to a certain
        standard before they are graduated, you see.”</p>
        <p>“Graduated?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. We have a standard of citizenship now—an idea of what
        people ought to be and how to make them so. Dear me! To think
        that you don’t know about that—”</p>
        <p>“I shouldn’t think they’d stand for it—all this examination
        and so on.”</p>
        <p>“No country on earth offers so much happiness to its people.
        Nowhere else—yet—is there as good opportunity to be helped up,
        to have real scientific care, real loving study and assistance!
        Everybody likes to be made the most of! Everybody—nearly—has the
        feeling that they might be something better if they had a
        chancel We give them the chance.”</p>
        <p>“Then I should think you’d have all creation on your hands at
        once.”</p>
        <p>“And depopulate the other nations? They had something to say
        about that! You see this worked all sorts of ways. In the first
        place, when we got all the worst and lowest people, that left an
        average of better ones at home—people who could learn more
        quickly. When we proved what good stuff human nature was,
        rightly treated, they all took heart of grace and began to
        improve their own. Then, as our superior attractions steadily
        drew off ‘the lower classes,’ that raised the value of those who
        remained. They were better paid, better thought of at home. As
        more and more people came to us, the other nations got rather
        alarmed, and began to establish counter attractions—to keep
        their folks at home. Also, many other nations had some better
        things than we did, you remember. And finally most people love
        their own country better than any other, no matter how good. No,
        the balance of population is not seriously altered.”</p>
        <p>“Still, with such an influx of low-grade people you must have
        a Malthusian torrent of increasing population on your
        hands.”</p>
        <p>Again that odd listening look, her head a little on one
        side.</p>
        <p>“I have to keep remembering,” she said. “Have to recall what
        people wrote and said and thought in the past generation. The
        idea was that people had to increase like rabbits, and would eat
        up the food supply, so wars and pestilences and all manner of
        cruel conditions were necessary to ‘keep down the population.’
        Wasn’t that it?”</p>
        <p>“You are twenty years out, my dear!” I rejoiced to assure
        her. “We had largely passed that, and were beginning to worry
        about the decreasing birth rate—among the more intelligent. It
        was only the lowest grade that kept on ‘like rabbits’ as you
        say. But it’s that sort you seem to have been filling in with. I
        should think it would have materially lowered the average. Or
        have you, in this new ‘forcing system’ made decent people out of
        scrubs?”</p>
        <p>“That’s exactly what we’ve done; we’ve improved the people
        and lowered the birth-rate at one stroke!”</p>
        <p>“They were beginning to talk eugenics when I left.”</p>
        <p>“This is not eugenics—we have made great advances in that, of
        course; but the chief factor in this change is a common
        biological law—‘individuation is in inverse proportion to
        reproduction,’ you know. We individualize the women—develop
        their personal power, their human characteristics—and they don’t
        have so many children.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t see how that helps unless you have eliminated the
        brutality of men.”</p>
        <p>“My dear brother, the brutality of men lowered the
        birthrate—it didn’t raise it! One of those undifferentiated
        peasant women would have a baby every year if she was married to
        a saint—and she couldn’t have more in polyandry—unless it were
        twins I No, the birthrate was for women to settle—and they
        have.”</p>
        <p>“Out of fashion to have children at all?”</p>
        <p>“No, John, you needn’t sneer. We have better children than
        ever were born on earth before, and they grade higher every
        year. But we are approaching a balanced population.”</p>
        <p>I didn’t like the subject, and turned to the clear skyline of
        the distant city. It towered as of old, but seemed not so
        close-packed. Not one black cloud—and very few white ones!</p>
        <p>“You’ve ended the smoke nuisance, I’m glad to see. Has steam
        gone, too?”</p>
        <p>“We use electricity altogether in all the cities now,” she
        said. “It occurred to us that to pipe a leaking death into every
        bedroom; to thread the city with poison, fire and explosion, was
        foolish.”</p>
        <p>“Defective wiring used to cause both death and conflagration,
        didn’t it?”</p>
        <p>“It did,” she admitted; “but it is not ‘defective’ any
        more.”</p>
        <p>“Is the coal all gone?”</p>
        <p>“No, but we burn it at the mines—by a process which does not
        waste ninety per cent of the energy—and transmit the power.”</p>
        <p>“For all New York?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. New York has enough water power, you see. The tide
        mills are enough for this whole region.”</p>
        <p>“They solved the tide-mill problem, did they?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. There are innumerable mechanical advances, of course.
        You’ll enjoy them.”</p>
        <p>We were near enough now to see the city clearly.</p>
        <p>“What a splendid water front!” I cried. “Why, this is
        glorious.”</p>
        <p>It surely was. The wide shores swung away, glittering in the
        pure sunlight. Staten Island lay behind us, a vision of terraced
        loveliness; the Jersey shore shone clear, no foul pall of oil
        smoke overhanging; the Brooklyn banks were banks of palaces, and
        Manhattan itself towered royally before us, all bordered with
        broad granite piers.</p>
        <p>“‘Marginal mile after mile of smooth-running granite
        embankment’” quoted Nellie. “’Broad steps of marble descending
        for the people to enter the water. White-pillared piers——”</p>
        <p>“Look at the water!” I cried, suddenly. “It’s clear!”</p>
        <p>“Of course it’s clear,” she agreed laughingly. “This is a
        civilized country, I tell you.”</p>
        <p>I looked and looked. It was blue and bright in the distance;
        it was a clear, soft green beneath us. I saw a fish leap ”</p>
        <p>“So far I’m with you, anyhow,” said I. “That certainly is a
        big step—and looks like a miracle. New York harbor clean! . . .
        How about customs?” I asked as we drew in.</p>
        <p>“Gone—clean forgotten—with a lot of other foolishness. The
        air ships settled that. We couldn’t plant custom houses in the
        air, you see—along ten thousand miles of coast and border.”</p>
        <p>I was watching the shore. There were plenty of people about,
        but strangely gay of aspect and bright-colored in raiment. I
        could see amusement piers—numbers of them—some evidently used as
        gymnasia, in some there was dancing. Motor cars of all
        descriptions ran swiftly and quietly about. Air ships, large and
        small, floated off, to the north and west mostly. The water was
        freckled with pleasure boats. I heard singing—and music.</p>
        <p>“Some new holiday?” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“Not at all,” said my sister. “It is afternoon.”</p>
        <p>She watched me, quizzically.</p>
        <p>“It is afternoon,” she repeated. “Let that sink in!”</p>
        <p>It sank in, slowly.</p>
        <p>“Do you mean that no one works in the afternoon?”</p>
        <p>“No one—except those who don’t work in the morning. Some
        kinds of work can’t stop, of course; but most kinds can. I told
        you before—no one has to work more than two hours a day; most
        people work four. Why?” She saw my unbelieving stare. “Because
        we like to. Also because we are ambitious,” she went on. “I told
        you of the gain we’ve made in ‘the civilized world.’ Not all of
        it is civilized. We are still missionarying. And while there is
        need of help anywhere on earth, most of us work overtime. Also
        it lays up public capital—we are planning some vast
        undertakings—and gives a wider margin for vacations.”</p>
        <p>I was thinking in a hazy way of a world that was not tired,
        not driven, no nose on any grindstone; of a people who only had
        to work two hours—and worked four! Yet there was every evidence
        of increased wealth.</p>
        <p>Suddenly Nellie gave a joyous little cry.</p>
        <p>“Why, there’s Owen!” she waved her veil. “And there’s Jerrold
        and Hallier. She fairly danced with pleasure.</p>
        <p>I could see a big grayish man madly waving his hat down
        there—and two young folks hopping up and down and flourishing
        handkerchiefs, among many similarly excited.</p>
        <p>“Oh, how good of him!” she cried. “I never dreamed they’d be
        here!”</p>
        <p>“Nellie,” said I sternly. “You never told me you were
        married!”</p>
        <p>“Why should I?” she asked innocently. “You never asked
        me.”</p>
        <p>I had not. I had seen that she signed her name “Ellen
        Robertson,” and I knew she was president of a college—how could
        I imagine her married. Married she evidently was, and even her
        long-lost brother was forgotten for a moment as the big man
        engulfed her in his gray overcoat, and the tall son and daughter
        added their arms to the group.</p>
        <p>But it was only a moment, and the big brotherly grasp of my
        new relation’s hand, the cordial nephewly grip, and affectionate
        niecely kiss gave me a new and unexpected sense of the joys of
        homecoming.</p>
        <p>These were people, real people, as warm and kind and cheery
        as people ever were; and they greeted me with evident good will.
        It was “Uncle John” in no time, and Hallie in especial seized
        upon me as her own.</p>
        <p>“I know mother’s got you all broken in by this time,” she
        said. “And that you are prepared for all manner of amazing
        disclosures. But Mother never told us how handsome you are,
        Uncle John!”</p>
        <p>“In vain is the net spread in sight of any bird,” murmured
        young Jerrold mischievously.</p>
        <p>“Don’t listen to him, Uncle! I am perfectly sincere,” she
        protested, leaning over to hug her mother again, and turning
        back to me with a confiding smile.</p>
        <p>“Why should I doubt such evident good judgment?” said I. And
        she slipped her hand in mine and squeezed it. Nellie sat there,
        looking as proud and happy and matronly and motherly as anybody
        could, and a great weight rolled off my heart. Some things were
        left of my old world anyway.</p>
        <p>We talked gaily and excitedly on our way of immediate plans,
        rolling smoothly along broad, open streets. A temporary
        conclusion was to stop at Hallie’s apartment for the time being;
        and I was conscious of a distinct sense of loss to think of my
        new-found niece being already married.</p>
        <p>“How still it is!” I presently observed. “Is that because it
        is afternoon, too?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no,” they assured me. “We aren’t as noisy as we used to
        be.”</p>
        <p>“These children don’t know anything about what we used to
        have to put up with,” said Owen. “They never were in New York
        while it was screaming. You see, there are no horses; all
        surface vehicles are rubber-tired; the minor delivery is
        pneumatic, and the freight all goes underneath—on those silent
        monorails.”</p>
        <p>The great city spread about us, clean as a floor, quiet as a
        country town by comparison with what I remembered; yet full of
        the stir and murmur of moving crowds. Everyone we passed or met
        looked happy and prosperous, and even my inexperienced eye
        caught a difference in costuming.</p>
        <p>“There’s no masquerade on, is there?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Oh, no—we all wear what we please, that’s all. Don’t you
        like it?” Nellie asked.</p>
        <p>Generally there appeared the trim short skirt I had noticed
        as so appropriate on ship-board; here and there a sort of
        Florentine gown, long, richly damasked; sometimes a Greekish
        flow of drapery; the men mostly knickerbockered. I couldn’t deny
        that it was pleasant to the eye, but it worried me a little none
        the less.</p>
        <p>“There’s no hurry, John,” said Nellie, always unobtrusively
        watching me. “Some things you’ll just have to get used to.”</p>
        <p>“Before I wholly accept this sudden new brother,” I presently
        suggested, “I’d like to know his name.”</p>
        <p>“Montrose—Owen Montrose, at your service,” he said, bowing
        his fine head. “Ateo-i Jerrold Montrose—and Hallie
        Robertson!”</p>
        <p>“Dear, dear!” I protested. “So it’s come to that, has
        it?”</p>
        <p>“It’s come to that—and we still love each other!” Nellie
        cheerfully agreed. “But it isn’t final. There’s a strong
        movement on foot to drop hereditary names altogether.”</p>
        <p>I groaned. “In the name of common humanity, don’t tell me
        anything worse than you have now!”</p>
        <p>Hallie’s apartment was in a big building, far uptown,
        overlooking the Hudson</p>
        <p>“I have to live in town nine months of the year, you see,
        Uncle, on account of my work,” she explained rather
        apologetically.</p>
        <p>“Hallie’s an official—and awfully proud of it,” her brother
        whispered very loudly.</p>
        <p>“Jerrold’s only a musician—and pretends to be proud of it!”
        she retorted. Whereat he forcibly held and kissed her.</p>
        <p>I could see no very strong difference between this brother
        and sister and others I had known—except that they were perhaps
        unusually affectionate.</p>
        <p>It was a big, handsome place. The front windows faced the
        great river, the rear ones opened on a most unexpected scene of
        loveliness. A big sheltered garden, every wall-space surrounding
        it a joy to the eye—rich masses of climbing vines, a few trees,
        a quiet fountain, beautiful stone seats and winding walks,
        flowers in profusion, and birds singing.</p>
        <p>“We used to have only the song of the tomcat in my time. Have
        you taught the cat to lie down with the canary—or killed
        him?”</p>
        <p>“There are no animals kept in cities any more—except the
        birds—and they come and</p>
        <p>“Mostly sparrows, I suppose?”</p>
        <p>“Nb; the sparrow went with the horse,” Owen replied. “And the
        mouse, the fly and the croton bug went with the kitchen.”</p>
        <p>I turned with a gesture of despair.</p>
        <p>“No homes left?”</p>
        <p>“I didn’t say ‘home’—I said ‘kitchen.’</p>
        <p>Brace up, old man! We still eat—and better food than you ever
        dreamed of in your hungriest youth.”</p>
        <p>“That’s a long story,” Nellie here suggested. “We mustn’t
        crowd him. Let’s get washed and rested a bit, and have some of
        that food you’re boasting of.”</p>
        <p>They gave me a room with a river window, and I looked out at
        the broad current, changed only in its lovely clearness, and at
        the changeless Palisades.</p>
        <p>Changeless? I started, and seized the traveling glass still
        on the strap.</p>
        <p>The high cliffs reached away to the northward, still wooded,
        though sprinkled with buildings; but the more broken section
        opposite the city was a picture of startling beauty.</p>
        <p>The water front was green-parked, white-piered, rimmed with
        palaces, and the broken slopes terraced and garlanded in rich
        foliage. White cottages and larger buildings climbed and nestled
        along the sunny slopes as on the cliffs at Capri. It was a place
        one would go far to see.</p>
        <p>I dropped my eyes to the nearer shore.</p>
        <p>Again the park, the boulevard, the gracious outlines of fine
        architecture.</p>
        <p>It was beautiful—undeniably beautiful—but a strange world to
        me. I felt like one at a play. A plain, ordinary American
        landscape ought not to look like a theatre curtain!</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-4.">Chapter 4.</h1>
        <p>THEY called me to supper. “Most of us have our heartiest meal
        in the middle of the day,” my sister said.</p>
        <p>“The average man, Victim of Copious Instruction,” added my
        brother-in-law, “does his work in the morning; the two hours
        that he has to, or the four that he usually puts in. Eight to
        twelve, or nine to one—that is the working day for everybody.
        Then home, rest, a bath maybe, and then—allow me to help you to
        some of our Improvements!”</p>
        <p>I was hungry, and this simple meal looked and smelled most
        appetizing. There was in particular a large shining covered
        dish, which, being opened, gave forth so savory a steam as
        fairly to make my mouth water. A crisp and toothsome bread was
        by my plate; a hot drink, which they laughingly refused to name,
        proved most agreeable; a suave, cool salad followed; fruits,
        some of which were new to me, and most delicate little cakes,
        closed the meal.</p>
        <p>They would not tell me a thing, only saying “Have some more!”
        and I did. Not till I had eaten, with continuous delight, three
        helpings from the large dish did I notice that it stood alone,
        so to speak.</p>
        <p>Nellie followed my eye with her usual prompt intelligence.
        “Yes,” she said, “this is all. But we can send for other things
        in the twinkling of an eye; what would you like?”</p>
        <p>I leaned back in my chair and looked at her reproachfully. “I
        would like some of that salad—not very much, please! And some of
        those Burbankian products yonder, and one particular brown
        little cake—if I can hold it.”</p>
        <p>Nellie smiled demurely. “Oh!” she mildly remarked, “I thought
        for the moment that our little supper seemed scant to you.”</p>
        <p>I glared at her, retorting, “Now I will not utter the
        grateful praises that were rising to my lips. I will even try to
        look critical and dissatisfied.” And I did, but they all
        laughed.</p>
        <p>“It’s no manner of use, Uncle John,” cried my pretty niece;
        “we saw you eat it.”</p>
        <p>“‘It’ indeed!” I protested. “What is this undeniably
        easy-to-take concoction you have stuffed me with?”</p>
        <p>“My esteemed new brother,” Owen answered, “we have been
        considering your case in conclave assembled, and we think it is
        wiser to feed you for awhile and demand by all the rites of
        hospitality that you eat what is set before you and ask no
        questions for conscience sake. When you begin to pine, to lose
        your appetite, to look wan and hollow-eyed, then we may
        reconsider. Meanwhile we will tell you everything you want to
        know about food in general, and even some particulars—present
        dishes always excepted.”</p>
        <p>“I will now produce information,” began Hallie, “my office
        being that of Food Inspector.”</p>
        <p>“Her main purpose in bringing you here, Uncle, was to give
        you food and then talk about it,” said Jerrold solemnly. Hallie
        only made a face at him, and went on:</p>
        <p>“We have a magnificent system of production and
        distribution,” she explained, “with a decreasing use of animal
        foods.”</p>
        <p>“Was this a vegetarian meal?” I asked in a hollow voice.</p>
        <p>“Mostly; but you shall have meat when you want it—better meat
        than you used to get, too.”</p>
        <p>“Cold Storage Meat?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no; that’s long since stopped. The way we manage about
        meat is this: A proper proportion of edible animals are raised
        under good conditions—nice, healthy, happy beasts; killed so
        that they don’t know it!—and never kept beyond a certain time
        limit.</p>
        <p>“You see,” she paused, looking for the moment like her
        mother, “the whole food business is changed—you don’t
        realize.”</p>
        <p>“Go ahead and tell me—tell me all—my life at present is that
        of Rollo, I perceive, and I am most complacent after this
        meal.”</p>
        <p>“Uncle, I rejoice in your discovery, I do indeed. You are an
        uncle after my own heart,” said Jerrold.</p>
        <p>So my fair niece, looking like any other charming girl in a
        pretty evening frock, began to expound her specialty. Her mother
        begged to interrupt for the moment. “Let me recall to him things
        as they were—which you hardly know, you happy child. Don’t
        forget, John, that when we were young we did not know what good
        food was.”</p>
        <p>I started to protest, but she shook her finger at me.</p>
        <p>“No, we didn’t, my dear boy. We knew ‘what we liked,’ as the
        people said at the picture show; but that did not make it
        good—good in itself or good for us. The world was ill-fed. Most
        of the food was below par; a good deal was injurious, some
        absolutely poison. People sold poison for food in 1910, don’t
        forget that! You may remember the row that was beginning to be
        made about it.”</p>
        <p>I admitted recalling something of the sort, though it had not
        particularly interested me at the time.</p>
        <p>“Well, that row went on—and gained in force. The women woke
        up.”</p>
        <p>“If you have said that once since we met, my dear sister,
        you’ve said it forty times. I wish you would make a parenthesis
        in these food discussions and tell me how, when and why the
        women woke up.”</p>
        <p>Nellie looked a little dashed, and Owen laughed outright.</p>
        <p>“You stand up for your rights, John!” he said, rising and
        slapping me on the shoulder. “Let’s go in the other room and
        settle down for a chin—it’s our fate.”</p>
        <p>“Hold him till he sees our housekeeping,” said Jerrold. I
        stood watching, while they rapidly placed our dishes—which I now
        noticed were very few—in a neat square case which stood on a
        side table. Everything went in out of sight; paper napkins from
        the same receptacle wiped the shining table; and then a
        smooth-running dumbwaiter took it from our sight.</p>
        <p>“This is housework,” said Nellie, mischievously.</p>
        <p>“I refuse to be impressed. Come back to our muttons,” I
        insisted. “You can tell me about your domestic sleight-of-hand
        in due season.”</p>
        <p>So we lounged in the large and pleasant parlor, the broad
        river before us, rimmed with starry lamps, sparkling everywhere
        with the lights of tiny pleasure craft, and occasionally the
        blaze and wash of larger boats. I had a sense of pleasant
        well-being. I had eaten heartily, very heartily, yet was not
        oppressed. My new-found family pleased me well. The quiet room
        was beautiful in color and proportion, and as my eyes wandered
        idly over it I noted how few in number and how harmonious were
        its contents giving a sense of peace and spaciousness.</p>
        <p>The air was sweet—I did not notice then, as I did later, that
        the whole city was sweet-aired now; at least by comparison with
        what cities used to be. From somewhere came the sound of soft
        music, grateful to the ear. I stretched myself luxuriously
        with:</p>
        <p>“Now, then, Nellie—let her go—‘the women woke up.’”</p>
        <p>“Some women were waking up tremendously, before you left,
        John Robertson, only I dare say you never noticed it. They just
        kept on, faster and faster, till they all did—about all. There
        are some Dodos left, even yet, but they don’t count—discredited
        grandmothers!”</p>
        <p>“And, being awake?” I gently suggested.</p>
        <p>“And being awake, they” She paused for an instant, seeking an
        expression, and Jerrold’s smooth bass voice put in, “They saw
        their duty and they did it.”</p>
        <p>“Exactly,” his mother agreed, with a proudly loving glance at
        him; “that’s just what they did! And in regard to the food
        business, they recognized at last that it was their duty to feed
        the world—and that it was miserably done! So they took
        hold.”</p>
        <p>“Now, mother, this is my specialty,” Hallie interposed.</p>
        <p>“When a person can only talk about one thing, why oppose
        them?” murmured Jerrold. But she quite ignored him, and
        re—opened her discussion.</p>
        <p>“We—that is, most of the women and some of the men—began to
        seriously study the food question, both from a hygienic and an
        economic standpoint. I can’t tell you that thirty years’ work in
        a minute, Uncle John, but here’s the way we manage it now: We
        have learned very definitely what people ought not to eat, and
        it is not only a punishable, but a punished offense to sell
        improper food stuffs.”</p>
        <p>“How are the people to know?” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“The people are not required to know everything. All the food
        is watched and tested by specialists; what goes into the market
        is good—all of it.”</p>
        <p>“By impeccable angelic specialists—like my niece?”</p>
        <p>She shook her head at me. “If they were not, the purchaser
        would spot them at once. You see, our food supply is not at the
        mercy of the millions of ignorant housewives any more. Food is
        bought and prepared by people who know how—and they have all the
        means—and knowledge—for expert tests.”</p>
        <p>“And if the purchaser too was humanly fallible?”</p>
        <p>She cast a pitying glance on me, and her father took the
        floor for a moment.</p>
        <p>“You see, John, in the old time the dealers were mostly poor,
        and sold cheap and bad stuff to make a little money. The buyers
        were mostly poor, and had to buy the cheap and nasty stuff. Even
        large manufacturers were under pressure, and had to cheat to
        make a profit—or thought they had to. Then when we got to
        inspectors and such like they were under the harrow, too, and
        were by no means impeccable. Our big change is this: Nobody is
        poor now.”</p>
        <p>“I hear you say that,” I answered, “but I can’t seem to get
        it through my head. Have you really divided all the
        property?”</p>
        <p>“John Robertson, I’m ashamed of you!” cried Nellie. “Even in
        1910 people knew better than that—people who knew anything!”</p>
        <p>“That wasn’t necessary,” said Owen, “nor desirable. What we
        have done is this: First, we have raised the productive capacity
        of the population; second, we have secured their right to our
        natural resources; third, we have learned to administer business
        without waste. The wealth of the world grows enormously. It is
        not what you call ‘equally distributed,’ but every one has
        enough. There is no economic danger any more; there is economic
        peace.”</p>
        <p>“And economic freedom?” asked I sharply.</p>
        <p>“And economic freedom. People choose the work they like best,
        and work—freely, more than they have to.”</p>
        <p>I pondered on this. “Ah, but they have to—labor is
        compulsory.”</p>
        <p>Owen grinned. “Yes, labor is compulsory—always was. It is
        compulsory on everyone now. We used to have two sets who
        wouldn’t work—paupers and the idle rich; no such classes
        left—all busy.”</p>
        <p>“But, the freedom of the individual”</p>
        <p>I persisted.</p>
        <p>“Come, come, brother; society always played hob with the
        freedom of the individuals whenever it saw fit. It killed,
        imprisoned, fined; it had compulsory laws and regulations; it
        required people to wear clothes and furnished no clothes for
        them to wear. If society has a right to take human life, why has
        it not a right to improve it? No, my dear man,” continued Owen
        (he was evidently launched on his specialty now) “society is not
        somebody else domineering over us! Society is us—taking care of
        ourselves.”</p>
        <p>I took no exception to this, and he began again. “Society, in
        our young days, was in a state of auto-intoxication. It
        generated its own poisons, and absorbed them in peaceful, slow
        suicide. To think!—it seems im possible now—to think of allowing
        anybody to sell bad food!”</p>
        <p>“That wasn’t the only bad thing they sold” I suggested.</p>
        <p>“No; unfortunately. Why, look here—” Owen slid a glass panel
        in the wall and took out a book.</p>
        <p>“That’s clever,” I remarked approvingly, “Bookcases built
        in!”</p>
        <p>“Yes, they are everywhere now,” said Nellie. “Books—a few of
        them—are common human necessities. Every home, every room
        almost, has these little dust-tight, insect-proof wall cases.
        Concrete construction has helped very much in all such
        matters.”</p>
        <p>Owen had found his place, and now poured upon me a
        concentrated list of the adulterated materials deteriorating the
        world in that period so slightingly referred to as “my day.” I
        noticed with gratitude that Owen said “When we were young!”</p>
        <p>“You never were sure of getting anything pure,” he said
        scornfully, “no matter what you paid for it. How we submitted to
        such rank outrage for so long I cannot imagine I This was taken
        up very definitely some twenty years ago, by the women
        mostly.”</p>
        <p>“Aha—‘when the women woke up!’” I cried.</p>
        <p>“Yes, just that. It is true that their being mostly mere
        housewives and seamstresses was a handicap in some ways; but it
        was a direct advantage in others. They were almost all
        consumers, you see, not producers. They were not so much
        influenced by considerations of the profits of the manufacturer
        as they were by the direct loss to their own pockets and health.
        Yes,” he smiled reminiscently, “there were some pretty warm
        years while this thing was thrashed out. One of the most
        successful lines of attack was in the New Food system,
        though.”</p>
        <p>“I <em>will</em> talk!” cried Hallie. “Here I’ve inveigled
        Uncle John up here—and—and fed him to repletion; and have him
        completely at my mercy, and then you people butt in and do all
        the talking!”</p>
        <p>“Go it, little sister—you’re dead right!” agreed Jerrold,
        “You see, Uncle, it’s one thing to restrain and prevent and
        punish—and another thing to substitute improvements.”</p>
        <p>“Kindergarten methods?” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“Yes, exactly. As women had learned this in handling
        children, they began to apply it to grown people—the same
        children, only a little older. Ever so many people had been
        talking and writing about this food business, and finally some
        of them got together and really started it.”</p>
        <p>“One of these cooperative schemes?” I was beginning, but the
        women looked at me with such pitying contempt that I promptly
        withdrew the suggestion.</p>
        <p>“Not much!” said Nellie disdainfully. “Of course, those
        cooperative schemes were a natural result of the growing
        difficulties in our old methods, but they were on utterly wrong
        lines. No, sir; the new food business was a real business, and a
        very successful one. The first company began about 1912 or ’13,
        I think. Just some women with a real business sense, and enough
        capital. They wisely concluded that a block of apartments was
        the natural field for their services; and that professional
        women were their natural patrons.”</p>
        <p>“The unprofessional women—or professional wives, as you might
        call them—had only their housewifery to preserve their
        self-respect, you see,” put in Owen. “If they didn’t do
        housekeeping for a living, what—in the name of decency—did they
        do?”</p>
        <p>“This was called the Home Service Company,” said Hallie. “(I
        will talk, mother!) They built some unusually attractive
        apartments, planned by women, to please women; this block was
        one of the finest designs of their architects—women, too, by the
        way.”</p>
        <p>“Who had waked up,” murmured Jerrold, unnoticed.</p>
        <p>“It was frankly advertised as specially designed for
        professional women. They looked at it, liked it, and moved it;
        teachers, largely doctors, lawyers, dressmakers; women who
        worked.”</p>
        <p>Sort of a nunnery?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“My dear brother, do you imagine that all working women were
        orphan spinsters, even in your day?” cried Nellie. “The
        self-supporting women of that time generally had other people to
        support, too. Lots of them were married; many were widows with
        children; even the single ones had brothers and sisters to take
        care of.”</p>
        <p>“They rushed in, anyhow,” said Hallie. “The place was
        beautiful and built for enjoyment. There was a nice garden in
        the middle”</p>
        <p>“Like this one here?” I interrupted. “This is a charming
        patio. How did they make space for it?”</p>
        <p>“New York blocks were not divinely ordained,” Owen replied.
        “It occurred to the citizens at last they they could bisect
        those 200x800-foot oblongs, and they did. Wide, tree-shaded,
        pleasant ways run between the old avenues, and the blocks
        remaining are practically squares.”</p>
        <p>“You noticed the irregular border of grass and shrubbery as
        we came up, didn’t you, Uncle?” asked Jerrold. “We forgot to
        speak about it, because we are used to it.”</p>
        <p>I did recall now that our ride had been not through
        monotonous, stone-faced, right-angled ravines, but along the
        pleasant fronts of gracious varying buildings, whose skyline was
        a pleasure and street line bordered greenly,</p>
        <p>“You didn’t live here and don’t remember, maybe,” Owen
        remarked, “but the regular thing uptown was one of those lean,
        long blocks, flat-faced and solid, built to the side-walk’s
        edge. If it was a line of private houses they were bordered with
        gloomy little stone-paved areas, and ornamented with ash-cans
        and garbage pails. If the avenue end was faced with tall
        apartments, their lower margin was infested with a row of little
        shops—meat, fish, vegetable, fruit—with all their litter and
        refuse and flies, and constant traffic. Now a residence block is
        a thing of beauty on all sides. The really necessary shops are
        maintained, but planned for in the building, and made beautiful.
        Those fly-tainted meat markets no longer exist.”</p>
        <p>“I will talk!” said Hallie, so plaintively that we all
        laughed and let her.</p>
        <p>“That first one I was telling you about was very charming and
        attractive. There were arrangements on the top floor for
        nurseries and child gardens; and the roof was for children all
        day; evenings the grown-ups had it. Great care was taken by the
        management in letting this part to the best professionals in
        child culture.</p>
        <p>“There were big rooms, too, for meetings and parties; places
        for billiards and bowling and swimming—it was planned for real
        human enjoyment, like a summer hotel.”</p>
        <p>“But I thought you said this place was for women,” I
        incautiously ventured.</p>
        <p>“Oh, Uncle John! And has it never occurred to you that women
        like to amuse themselves? Or that professional women have men
        relatives and men friends? There were plenty of men in the
        building, and plenty more to visit it. They were shown how nice
        it was, you see. But the chief card was the food and service.
        This company engaged, at high wages, first-class houseworkers,
        and the residents paid for them by the hour; and they had a food
        service which was beyond the dreams of—of—homes, or boarding
        houses.”</p>
        <p>“Your professional women must have been millionaires,” I
        mildly suggested.</p>
        <p>“You think so because you do not understand the food
        business, Uncle John; nobody did in those days. We were so used
        to the criminal waste of individual house-keeping, with its
        pitifully low standards, and to monotonous low-grade restaurant
        meals, with their waste and extortion, that it never occurred to
        us to estimate the amount of profit there really was in the
        business. These far-seeing women were pioneers—but not for long!
        Dozens are claiming first place now, just as the early ‘Women’s
        Clubs’ used to.</p>
        <p>“They established in that block a meal service that was a
        wonder for excellence, and for cheapness, too; and people began
        to learn.”</p>
        <p>I was impressed, but not convinced, and she saw it.</p>
        <p>“Look here, Uncle John, I hate to use figures on a helpless
        listener, but you drive me to it.”</p>
        <p>Then she reached for the bookcase and produced her evidence,
        sparingly, but with effect. She showed me that the difference
        between the expense of hiring separate service and the same
        number of people patronizing a service company was sufficient to
        reduce expenses to the patrons and leave a handsome payment for
        the company</p>
        <p>Owen looked on, interpreting to my ignorance.</p>
        <p>“You never kept house, old, man,” he said, “nor thought much
        about it, I expect; but you can figure this out for yourself
        easily enough. Here were a hundred families, equal to, say, five
        hundred persons. They hired a hundred cooks, of course; paid
        them something like six dollars a week—call it five on an
        average. There’s $500 a week, just for cooks—$26,000 a year!</p>
        <p>“Now, as a matter of fact (our learned daughter tells us
        this), ten cooks are plenty for five hundred persons—at the same
        price would cost $1,300 a year!”</p>
        <p>“Ten are plenty, and to spare,” said Hallie; “but we pay them
        handsomely. One chef at $3,000; two next bests at $2,000 each,
        four thousand; two at $1,000 apiece, two thousand; five at $800,
        four thousand. That’s $18,000—half what we paid before, and the
        difference in service between a kitchen maid and a scientific
        artist.”</p>
        <p>“Fifty per cent, saved on wages, and 500 per cent, added to
        skill,” Owen continued. “And you can go right on and add 90 per
        cent, saving in fuel, 90 per cent, in plant, 50 per cent, in
        utensils, and—how much is it, Hallie, in materials?”</p>
        <p>Hallie looked very important.</p>
        <p>“Even when they first started, when food was shamefully
        expensive and required all manner of tests and examinations, the
        saving was all of 60 per cent. Now it is fully 80 per cent.”</p>
        <p>“That makes a good deal all told, Uncle John,” Jerrold
        quietly remarked, handing me a bit of paper. “You see, it does
        leave a margin of profit.”</p>
        <p>I looked rather helplessly at the figures; also at
        Hallie.</p>
        <p>“It is a shame, Uncle, to hurry you so, but the sooner you
        get these little matters clear in your head, the better. We have
        these great food furnishing companies, now, all over the
        country; and they have market gardens and dairies and so on, of
        their own. There is a Food Bureau in every city, and a National
        Food Bureau, with international relations. The best scientific
        knowledge is used to study food values, to improve old materials
        and develop new ones; there’s a tremendous gain.”</p>
        <p>“But—do the people swallow things as directed by the
        government?” I protested. “Is there no chance to go and buy what
        you want to eat when you want it?”</p>
        <p>They rose to their feet with one accord. Jerrold seized me by
        the hand.</p>
        <p>“Come on, Uncle!” he cried. “Now is as good a time as any.
        You shall see our food department—come to scoff and remain to
        prey—if you like.”</p>
        <p>The elevator took us down, and I was led unresistingly among
        their shining modernities.</p>
        <p>“Here is the source of supply,” said Owen, showing where the
        basement supply room connected with a clean, airy subway under
        the glass-paved sidewalk. “Ice we make, drinking water we
        distil, fuel is wired to us; but the food stuffs are brought
        this way. Come down early enough and you would find these
        arteries of the city flowing steadily with——”</p>
        <p>“Milk and honey,” put in Jerrold.</p>
        <p>“With the milk train, the meat train, the vegetable train,
        and so on.”</p>
        <p>“Ordered beforehand?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Ordered beforehand. Up to midnight you may send down word as
        to the kind of mushrooms you prefer—and no extra charge. During
        the day you can still order, but there’s a trifle more
        expense—not much. But most of us are more than content to have
        our managers cater for us. From the home outfit you may choose
        at any time. There are lists upstairs, and here is the
        array.”</p>
        <p>There were but few officials in this part of the great
        establishment at this hour, but we were politely shown about by
        a scholarly looking man in white linen, who had been reading as
        we entered. They took me between rows of glass cases, standing
        as books do in the library, and showed me the day’s baking; the
        year’s preserves; the fragrant, colorful shelves of such fruit
        and vegetables as were not fresh picked from day to day.</p>
        <p>“We don’t get today’s strawberries till the local ones are
        ripe,” Jerrold told us.</p>
        <p>“These are yesterday’s, and pretty good yet.”</p>
        <p>“Excuse me, but those have just come in,” said the
        white-linen person; “this morning’s picking, from Maryland.”</p>
        <p>I tasted them with warm approval. There was a fascinating
        display of cakes and cookies, some old favorites, some of a new
        but attractive aspect; and in glass-doored separate
        ice-chambers, meats, fish, milk, and butter.</p>
        <p>“Can people come in here and get what they want, though?” I
        inquired triumphantly.</p>
        <p>“They can, and occasionally they do. But what it will take
        you some time to realize, John,” my sister explained, “is the
        different attitude of people toward their food. We are all not
        only well fed—sufficiently fed—but so wisely fed that we seldom
        think of wanting anything further. When we do we can order from
        upstairs, come down to the eating room and order, send to the
        big depots if it is some rare thing, or even come in like this.
        To the regular purchasers it is practically free,”</p>
        <p>“And how if you are a stranger—a man in the street?”</p>
        <p>“In every city in our land you may go into any eating house
        and find food as good—and cheap—as this,” said Hallie,
        triumphantly.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-5.">Chapter 5.</h1>
        <p>WHILE below they took me into the patio, that quiet inner
        garden which was so attractive from above. It was a lovely
        place. The moon was riding high and shone down into it; a
        slender fountain spray rose shimmering from its carved basin; on
        the southern-facing wall a great wistaria vine drooped in
        budding purple, and beds of violets made the air rich with soft
        fragrance.</p>
        <p>Here and there were people walking; and in the shadowy
        corners sat young couples, apparently quite happy.</p>
        <p>“I suppose you don’t know the names of one of them,” I
        suggested.</p>
        <p>“On the contrary, I know nearly all,” answered Hallie. “These
        apartments are taken very largely by friends and acquaintances.
        You see, the gardens and roofs are in common, and there are the
        reading-rooms, ballrooms, and so on. It is pleasanter to be
        friends to begin with, and most of us get to be afterward, if we
        are not at first.</p>
        <p>“But surely there are some disagreeable people left on
        earth!”</p>
        <p>“Yes; but where there is so much more social life people get
        together in congenial sets,” put in Nellie; “just as we used to
        in summer resorts.,,</p>
        <p>“There aren’t so many bores and fools as there used to be,
        John,” Owen remarked. “We really do raise better people. Even
        the old ones have improved. You see, life is so much pleasanter
        and more interesting.”</p>
        <p>“We’re all healthier, Uncle John, because we’re better fed;
        that makes us more agreeable.”</p>
        <p>“There’s more art in the world to make us happier,” said
        Jerrold. “Hallie thinks it’s all due to her everlasting bread
        and butter. Listen to that now!”</p>
        <p>From a balcony up there in the moonlight came a delicious
        burst of melody; a guitar and two voices, and the refrain was
        taken up from another window, from one corner of the garden,
        from the roof; all in smooth accord.</p>
        <p>“Your group here must be an operatic one,” I suggested. But
        my nephew answered that it was not, but that music—good
        music—was so common now, and so well taught, that the average
        was high in both taste and execution.</p>
        <p>We sat late that night, my new family bubbling over with
        things to say, and filling my mind with a confused sense of new
        advantages, unexplained and only half believed.</p>
        <p>I could not bring myself to accept as commonplace facts the
        unusual excellences so glibly described, and I suppose my
        silence showed this as well as what I said, for my sister
        presently intervened with decision:</p>
        <p>“We must all stop this for tonight,” she said. “John feels as
        if he was being forcibly fed—he’s got to rest. Then I suggest
        that tomorrow Owen take him in hand—go off for a tramp, why
        don’t you?—and really straighten out things. You see, there are
        two distinct movements to consider, the unconscious progress
        that would have taken place anyway in thirty years, and then the
        deliberate measures adopted by the ‘New Lifers,’ and it’s rather
        confusing. I’ve labored with him all the way home now; I think
        the man’s point of view will help.”</p>
        <p>Owen was a big man with a strong, wholesome face, and a
        quizzical little smile of his own. He and I went up the river
        next morning in a swift motor boat, which did not batter the
        still air with muffled banging as they used to do, and strolled
        off in the bright spring sunshine into Palisade Park.</p>
        <p>“We’ve saved all the loveliest of it—for keeps,” he said.
        “Out here, where the grass and trees are just as they used to
        be, you won’t be bothered, and one expositor will be easier to
        handle than four at once. Now, shall I talk, or will you ask
        questions?”</p>
        <p>“I’d like to ask a few questions first, then you can expound
        by the hour. Do give me the long and short of this
        ‘Women-waked-up’ proposition. What does it mean—to a man?”</p>
        <p>Owen stroked his chin.</p>
        <p>“No loss,” he said at length; “at least, no loss that’s not
        covered by a greater gain. Do you remember the new biological
        theory in regard to the relative position of the sexes that was
        beginning to make headway when we were young?”</p>
        <p>I nodded. “Ward’s theory? Oh, yes; I heard something of it.
        Pretty far-fetched, it seemed to me.”</p>
        <p>“Far-fetched and dear-bought, but true for all that. You’ll
        have to swallow it. The female is the race type; the male is her
        assistant. It’s established beyond peradventure.”</p>
        <p>I meditated, painfully. I looked at Owen. He had just as
        happy and proud a look as if he was a real man—not merely an
        Assistant. I though of Jerrold—nothing cowed about him; of the
        officers and men on the ship; of such men as I had seen in the
        street.</p>
        <p>“I suppose this applies in the main to remote origins?” I
        suggested.</p>
        <p>“It holds good all through life—is just as true as it ever
        was.”</p>
        <p>“Then—do you mean that women run everything, and men are only
        helpers?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no; I wasn’t talking about human life at all—only about
        sex. ‘Running things’ has nothing to do with that. Women run
        some businesses and are in practically all, but men still do the
        bulk of the world’s work. There is a natural division of labor,
        after all.”</p>
        <p>This was pleasant to hear, but he dashed my hopes.</p>
        <p>“Men do almost all the violent plain work—digging and hewing
        and hammering; women, as a class, prefer the administrative and
        constructive kinds. But all that is open yet, and settling
        itself gradually; men and women are working everywhere. The big
        change which Nellie is always referring to means simply that
        women ‘waked up’ to a realization of the fact that they were
        human beings.”</p>
        <p>“What were they before, pray?”</p>
        <p>“Only female beings.”</p>
        <p>“Female human beings, of course,” said I.</p>
        <p>“Yes; a little human, but mostly female. Now they are mostly
        human. It is a great change.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t follow you. Aren’t they still wives and
        mothers?”</p>
        <p>“They are still mothers—far more so than they were before, as
        a matter of fact; but as to being wives—there’s a
        difference.”</p>
        <p>I was displeased, and showed it.</p>
        <p>“Well, is it Polygamy, or Polyandry, or Trial Marriages, or
        what?”</p>
        <p>Owen gazed at me with an expression very like Nellie’s.</p>
        <p>“There it is,” he said. “You can only think about women in
        some sort of relation to men, of a change in marriage relations
        as merely a change in kind; whereas what has happened is a
        change in degree. We still have monogamous marriages, on a much
        purer and more lasting plane than a generation ago; but the word
        ‘wife’ does not mean what it used to.”</p>
        <p>“Go on—I can’t follow you at all.”</p>
        <p>“A ‘wife’ used to be a possession; ‘wilt thou be mine?’ said
        the lover, and the wife was his.”</p>
        <p>“Well—whose else is she now?” I asked with some
        sharpness.</p>
        <p>“She does not ‘belong’ to anyone in that old sense. She is
        the wife of her husband in that she is his true lover, and that
        their marriage is legally recorded; but her life and work does
        not belong to him. He has no right to her ‘services’ any more. A
        woman who is in a business—like Hallie, for instance—does not
        give it up when she marries.”</p>
        <p>I stopped him. “What! Isn’t Hallie married?”</p>
        <p>“No—not yet.”</p>
        <p>“But—that is her flat?”</p>
        <p>“Yes; why not?” He laughed at me. “You see, you can’t imagine
        a woman having a home of her own. Hallie is twenty-three. She
        won’t marry for some years, probably; but she has her position
        and is doing excellent work. It’s only a minor inspectorship,
        but she likes it. Why shouldn’t she have a home?”</p>
        <p>“Why doesn’t she have it with you?”</p>
        <p>“Because I like to live with my wife. Her business, and mine,
        are in Michigan; Hallie’s in New York.”</p>
        <p>“And when she marries she keeps on being an inspector?” I
        queried.</p>
        <p>“Precisely. The man who marries that young woman will have
        much happiness, but he will not ‘own’ her, and she will not be
        his wife in the sense of a servant. She will not darn his socks
        or cook his meals. Why should she?” “Will she not nurse his
        babies?” “No; she will nurse her babies—their babies, not ‘his’
        merely.”</p>
        <p>“And keep on being an inspector?” “And keep on being an
        inspector—for four hours a day—in two shifts. Not a bit more
        difficult than cooking, my dear boy.” “But—she will not be with
        her children—” “She will be with her children twenty hours out
        of the twenty-four—if she wants to. But Hallie’s not specially
        good with children. . . . You see, John, the women have
        specialized—even in motherhood.” Then he went on at considerable
        length to show how there had arisen a recognition of far more
        efficient motherhood than was being given; that those women best
        fitted for the work had given eager, devoted lives to it and
        built up a new science of Humaniculture; that no woman was
        allowed to care for her children without proof of capacity.
        “Allowed by whom?” I put in.</p>
        <p>“By the other women—the Department of Child Culture—the
        Government.”</p>
        <p>“And the fathers—do they submit to this, tamely?”</p>
        <p>“No; they cheerfully agree and approve. Absolutely the
        biggest thing that has happened, some of us think, is that new
        recognition of the importance of childhood. We are raising
        better people now.”</p>
        <p>I was silent for a while, pulling up bits of grass and
        snapping small sticks into inch pieces.</p>
        <p>“There was a good deal of talk about Eugenics, I remember,” I
        said at last, “and—what was that thing? Endowment of
        Motherhood?”</p>
        <p>“Yes—man’s talk,” Owen explained. “You see, John, we couldn’t
        look at women but in one way—in the old days; it was all a
        question of sex with us—inevitably, we being males. Our whole
        idea of improvement was in better breeding; our whole idea of
        motherhood was in each woman’s devoting her whole life to her
        own children. That turbid freshet of an Englishman, Wells, who
        did so much to stir his generation, said</p>
        <p>‘I am wholly feminist’—and he was I He saw women only as
        females and wanted them endowed as such. He was never able to
        see them as human beings and amply competent to take care of
        themselves.</p>
        <p>“Now, our women, getting hold of this idea that they really
        are human creatures, simply blossomed forth in new efficiency.
        They specialized the food business—Hallie’s right about the
        importance of that—and then they specialized the baby business.
        All .women who wish to, have babies; but if they wish to take
        care of them they must show a diploma.”</p>
        <p>I looked at him. I didn’t like it—but what difference did
        that make? I had died thirty years ago, it appeared.</p>
        <p>“A diploma for motherhood!” I repeated; but he corrected
        me.</p>
        <p>“Not at all. Any woman can be a mother—if she’s normal. I
        said she had to have a diploma as a child-culturist—quite a
        different matter.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t see the difference.”</p>
        <p>“No, I suppose not. I didn’t, once,” he said. “Any and every
        mother was supposed to be competent to ‘raise’ children—and look
        at the kind of people we raised! You see, we are beginning to
        learn—just beginning. You needn’t imagine that we are in a state
        of perfection—there are more new projects up for discussion than
        ever before. We’ve only made a start. The consequences, so far,
        are so good that we are boiling over with propositions for
        future steps.”</p>
        <p>“Go on about the women,” I said. “I want to know the worst
        and become resigned.”</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing very bad to tell,” he continued cheerfully.
        “When a girl is born she is treated in all ways as if she was a
        boy; there is no hint made in any distinction between them
        except in the perfectly open physiological instruction as to
        their future duties. Children, young humans, grow up under
        precisely the same conditions. I speak, of course, of the most
        advanced people—there are still backward places—there’s plenty
        to do yet.</p>
        <p>“Then the growing girls are taught of their place and power
        as mothers—and they have tremendously high ideals. That’s what
        has done so much to raise the standard in men. It came hard, but
        it worked.”</p>
        <p>I raised my head with keen interest, remarking, “I’ve
        glimpsed a sort of Iron hand in a velvet glove back of all this.
        What did they do?”</p>
        <p>Owen looked rather grim for a moment.</p>
        <p>“The worst of it was twenty or twenty-five years back. Most
        of those men are dead. That new religious movement stirred the
        socio-ethical sense to sudden power; it coincided with the
        women’s political movement, urging measures for social
        improvement; its enormous spread, both by preaching and
        literature, lit up the whole community with new facts, ideas and
        feelings. Health—physical purity—was made a practical ideal. The
        young women learned the proportion of men with syphilis and
        gonorrhoea and decided it was wrong to marry them. That was
        enough. They passed laws in every State requiring a clean bill
        of health with every marriage license. Diseased men had to die
        bachelors—that’s all.”</p>
        <p>“And did men submit to legislation like that?” I
        protested.</p>
        <p>“Why not? It was so patently for the protection of the
        race—of the family—of the women and children. Women were solid
        for it, of course—And all the best men with them. To oppose it
        was almost a confession of guilt and injured a man’s chances of
        marriage.”</p>
        <p>“It used to be said that any man could find a woman to marry
        him,” I murmured, meditatively.</p>
        <p>“Maybe he could—once. He certainly cannot now. A man who has
        one of those diseases is so reported—just like small-pox, you
        see. Moreover, it is registered against him by the Department of
        Eugenics—physicians are required to send in lists; any girl can
        find out.”</p>
        <p>“It must have left a large proportion of unmarried
        women.”</p>
        <p>“It did, at first. And that very thing was of great value to
        the world. They were wise, conscientious, strong women, you see,
        and they poured all their tremendous force into social service.
        Lots of them went into child culture—used their mother-power
        that way. It wasn’t easy for them; it wasn’t easy for the
        left-over men, either!”</p>
        <p>“It must have increased prostitution to an awful extent,” I
        said.</p>
        <p>Owen shook his head and regarded me quizzically.</p>
        <p>“That is the worst of it,” he said. “There isn’t any.”</p>
        <p>I sat up. I stood up. I walked up and down. “No prostitution!
        I—I can’t believe it. Why, prostitution is a social necessity,
        as old as Nineveh!”.</p>
        <p>Owen laughed outright. “Too late, old man; too late! I know
        we used to think so. We did use to call it a ‘social necessity,’
        didn’t we? Come, now, tell me what necessity it was to the
        women?”</p>
        <p>I stopped my march and looked at him.</p>
        <p>“To the women,” he repeated. “What did they want of
        prostitution? What good did it do them?”</p>
        <p>“Why—why—they made a living at it,” I replied, rather
        lamely.</p>
        <p>“Yes, a nice, honorable, pleasant, healthy living, didn’t
        they? With all women perfectly well able to earn an excellent
        living decently; with all women fully educated about these
        matters and knowing what a horrible death was before them in
        this business; with all women brought up like human beings and
        not like over-sexed female animals, and with all women quite
        free to marry if they wished to—how many, do you think, would
        choose that kind of business?</p>
        <p>“We never waited for them to choose it, remember! We fooled
        them and lied to them and dragged them in—and drove them
        in—forced them in—and kept them as slaves and prisoners. They
        didn’t really enjoy the life; you know that. Why should they go
        into it if they do not have to—to accommodate us?”</p>
        <p>“Do you mean to tell me there are no—wantons—among women?” I
        demanded.</p>
        <p>“No, I don’t mean any such thing. There are various kinds of
        over-developed and morbidly developed women as there are men,
        and we haven’t weeded them out entirely. But the whole thing is
        now recognized as pathological—cases for medical treatment, or
        perhaps surgical. Besides, wantonness is not prostitution.
        Prostitution is a social crime of the worst order. No one thing
        did more harm. The women stamped it out.”</p>
        <p>“Legislated us all into morality, did they?” I inquired
        sarcastically.</p>
        <p>“Legislation did a good deal; education did more; the new
        religion did most; social opinion helped. You remember we men
        never really tried to legislate against prostitution—we wanted
        it to go on.”</p>
        <p>“Why, surely we did legislate against it—and it was of no
        use!” I protested.</p>
        <p>“No; we legislated against the women, but not against the
        men, or the thing itself. We examined the women, and fined them,
        and licensed them—and never did anything against the men. Women
        legislators used very different measures, I assure you.”</p>
        <p>“I suppose it is for the good of the world,” I presently
        admitted; “but”</p>
        <p>“But you don’t quite like to think of men in this new and
        peculiar position of having to be good!”</p>
        <p>“Frankly—I don’t. I’m willing to be good, but—I don’t like to
        be given no choice.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now, look at it. As it was, we had one way, according
        to what we thought was good for us. Rather than lead clean,
        contented lives at some expense to ourselves in the way of moral
        and physical control, we deliberately sacrificed an army of
        women to a horrible life and a more horrible death, and
        corrupted the blood of the nation. It was on the line of health
        they made their stand, not on ‘morality’ alone. Under our new
        laws it is held a crime to poison another human being with
        syphilis, just as much as to use prussic acid.”</p>
        <p>“Nellie said you had no crime now.” “Oh, well, Nellie is an
        optimist. I suppose she meant the old kinds and definitions. We
        don’t call things ‘crimes’ any more. And then, really, there is
        not a hundredth part of the evil done that there used to be. We
        know more, you see, and have less temptation.”</p>
        <p>We were silent for a while. I watched a gull float and wheel
        over the blue water. Big airships flew steadily along certain
        lines. Little ones sailed about on all sides.</p>
        <p>One darted over our heads and lit with a soft swoop on an
        open promontory.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t they use to buzz?” I asked Owen, “Of course; just as
        the first motor boats thumped and banged abominably. We will not
        stand for unnecessary noise, as we used to.”</p>
        <p>“How do you stop it? More interference with the individual
        rights?”</p>
        <p>“More recognition of public rights. A bad noise is a
        nuisance, like a bad smell. We didn’t used to mind it much—but
        the women did. You see, what women like has to be considered
        now.”</p>
        <p>“It always was considered!” I broke in with some heat. “The
        women of America were the most spoiled, pampered lot on earth;
        men gave up to them in all ways.”</p>
        <p>“At home, perhaps, but not in public. The city and state
        weren’t run to suit them at all.”</p>
        <p>“Why should they be? Women belong at home. If they push into
        a man’s world they ought to take the consequences.”</p>
        <p>Owen stretched his long legs and looked up at the soft,
        brilliant blue above us.</p>
        <p>“Why do you call the world ’man’s?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“It was man’s; it ought to be. Woman’s place is in the home.
        I suppose I sound like ancient history to you?” and I laughed a
        little shamefacedly.</p>
        <p>“We have rather lost that point of view,”</p>
        <p>Owen guardedly admitted. “You see” and then he laughed. “It’s
        no use, John; no matter how we put it to you it’s a jar. The
        world’s thought has changed—and you have got to catch up!”</p>
        <p>“Suppose I refuse? Suppose I really am unable?”</p>
        <p>“We won’t suppose it for a moment,” he said cheerfully.
        “Ideas are not nailed down. Just take out what you had and
        insert some new ones. Women are people—just as much as we are;
        that’s a fact, my dear fellow. You’ll have to accept it.”</p>
        <p>“And are men allowed to be people, too?” I asked
        gloomily.</p>
        <p>“Why, of course! Nothing has interfered with our position as
        human beings; it is only our sex supremacy that we have
        lost.”</p>
        <p>“And do you like it?” I demanded.</p>
        <p>“Some men made a good deal of fuss at first—the old-fashioned
        kind, and all the worst varieties. But modern men aren’t worried
        in the least over their position. ., .</p>
        <p>See here, John, you don’t grasp this—women are vastly more
        agreeable than they used to be.”</p>
        <p>I looked at him in amazement.</p>
        <p>“Fact!” he said. “Of course, we loved our own mothers and
        daughters and sisters, more or less, no matter how they looked
        or what they did; and when we were ‘in love’ there was no limit
        to the glory of ‘the beloved object.’ But you and I know that
        women were pretty unsatisfactory in the old days.”</p>
        <p>I refused to admit it, but he went on calmly.</p>
        <p>“The ‘wife and mother’ was generally a tired, nervous,
        overworked creature. She soon lost her beauty and vigor, her
        charm and inspiration. We were forever chasing fine, handsome,
        highly desirable young girls, and forever reducing them to
        weary; worn-out women—in the name of love! The gay outsiders
        were always a fresh attraction—as long as we couldn’t have them.
        . . . See here, John, can’t you understand? Our old way of using
        women wasn’t good for them—nor for us, either, by the way—but it
        simply spoiled the women. They were hopelessly out of the
        running with us in all human lines; their business was
        housework, and ours was world work. There was very little real
        companionship.</p>
        <p>“Now women are intelligent, experienced, well-trained
        citizens, fully our equals in any line of work they take up, and
        with us everywhere. It’s made the world over!”</p>
        <p>“Made it ‘feminist’ through and through, I suppose!” I
        groaned.</p>
        <p>“Not a bit! It used to be ‘masculist’ through and through;
        now it’s just human. And, see here—women are more attractive, as
        women, than they used to be.”</p>
        <p>I stared at this, unbelieving.</p>
        <p>“That’s true! You see, they are healthy; there’s a new
        standard of physical beauty—very Greek—you must have noticed
        already the big, vigorous, fresh-colored, free-stepping
        girls.”</p>
        <p>I had, even in my brief hours of observation.</p>
        <p>“They are far more perfect physically, better developed
        mentally, with a higher moral sense—yes, you needn’t look like
        that! We used to call them our ‘moral superiors,’ just because
        they had the one virtue we insisted on—and we never noticed the
        lack in other lines. Women today are truthful, brave, honest,
        generous, self—controlled; they are—jollier, more reasonable,
        more companionable.”</p>
        <p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that,” I rather grudgingly admitted.
        “I was afraid they would have lost all—charm.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, we used to feel that way, I remember. Funny! We were
        convinced on the one hand that there was nothing to a woman but
        her eternal womanliness, and on the other we were desperately
        afraid her womanliness would disappear the moment she turned her
        mind to anything else. I assure you that men love women, in
        general and in particular, much more than they used to.”</p>
        <p>I pondered. “But—what sort of home life do you have?”</p>
        <p>“Think for a moment of what we used to have—even in a ‘happy
        home.’ The man had the whole responsibility of keeping it up—his
        business life and interests all foreign to her. She had the
        whole labor of running it—the direct manual labor in the great
        majority of cases—the management in any case. They were
        strangers in an industrial sense.</p>
        <p>“When he came home he had to drop all his line of thought—and
        she hers, except that she generally unloaded on him the burden
        of inadequacy in housekeeping. Sometimes he unloaded, too. They
        could sympathize and condole, but neither could help the
        other.</p>
        <p>“The whole thing cost like sin, too. It was a living
        nightmare to lots of men—and women! The only things they had in
        common were their children and ‘social interests.’</p>
        <p>“Well—nowadays, in the first place every body is easy about
        money. (I’ll go into that later.) No woman marries except for
        love—and good judgment, too; all women are more desirable—more
        men want to marry them—and that improves the men! You see, a man
        naturally cares more for women than for anything else in
        life—and they know it! It’s the handle they lift by. That’s what
        has eliminated tobacco.”</p>
        <p>“Do you mean to say that these women have arbitrarily
        prevented smoking?” I do not smoke myself, but I was angry
        nevertheless.</p>
        <p>“Not a bit of it, John—not a bit of it. Anybody can smoke who
        wants to.” “Then why don’t they?” “Because women do not like
        it.” “What has that to do with it? Can’t a man do what he wants
        to—even if they don’t like it?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, he can; but it costs too much. Men like tobacco, but
        they like love better, old man.”</p>
        <p>“Is it one of your legal requirements for marriage?”</p>
        <p>“No, not legal; but women disapprove of tobacco-y lovers,
        husbands, fathers; they know that the excessive use of it is
        injurious, and won’t marry a heavy smoker. But the main point is
        that they simply don’t like the smell of the stuff, or of the
        man who uses it—most women, that is.”</p>
        <p>“But what difference does it make? I dare say that most women
        did not like it before, but surely a man has a right”</p>
        <p>“To make himself a disgusting object to his wife,” Owen
        interrupted. “Yes, he has a ‘right’ to. We would have a right to
        bang on a tin pan, I suppose—or to burn rubber, but he wouldn’t
        be popular!”</p>
        <p>“It’s tyranny!” I protested.</p>
        <p>“Not at all,” he said, imperturbably. “We had no idea what a
        nuisance we used to be, that’s all; or how much women put up
        with that they did not like at all. I asked a woman once—when I
        was a bachelor—why she objected to tobacco, and she frankly
        replied that a man who did not smoke was much pleasanter to kiss
        I She was a very fascinating little widow—I confess it made me
        think.”</p>
        <p>“It’s the same with liquor, I suppose? Let’s get it all
        told.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, only more so. Alcoholism was a race evil of the worst
        sort. I cannot imagine how we put up with it so long.”</p>
        <p>“Is this spotless world of yours one solid temperance
        union?”</p>
        <p>“Practically. We use some light wines and a little spirits
        yet, but infrequently—in this country, at least, and Europe is
        vastly improved.</p>
        <p>“But that was a much more serious thing than the other. It
        wasn’t a mere matter of not marrying! They used all kinds of
        means. But come on—we’ll be late to dinner; and dinner, at
        least, is still a joy, Brother John.”</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
        <p>OUT of the mass of information offered by my new family and
        the pleasant friends we met, together with the books and
        publications profusely piling around me, I felt it necessary to
        make a species of digest for my own consideration. This I
        submitted to Nellie, Owen, and one or two others, adding
        suggestions and corrections; and thus established in my own mind
        a coherent view of what had happened.</p>
        <p>In the first place, as Owen repeatedly assured me, nothing
        was done—finished—brought to static perfection.</p>
        <p>“Thirty years isn’t much, you see,” he said cheerfully. “I
        dare say if you’d been here all along you wouldn’t think it was
        such a great advance. We have removed some obvious and utterly
        unnecessary evils, and cleared the ground for new beginnings;
        but what we are going to do is the exciting thing!</p>
        <p>“Now you think it is so wonderful that we have no poverty. We
        think it is still more wonderful that a world of even partially
        sane people could have borne poverty so long.”</p>
        <p>We naturally discussed this point a good deal, and they
        brought up a little party of the new economists to enlighten
        me—Dr. Harkness, sociologist; Mr. Alfred Brown, Department of
        Production; Mrs. Allerton of the Local Transportation Bureau;
        and a young fellow named Pike, who had written a little book on
        “Distinctive Changes of Three Decades,” which I found very
        useful.</p>
        <p>“It was such a simple matter, after all, you see,” the
        sociologist explained to me, in an amiable class-room
        manner.</p>
        <p>“Suppose now you were considering the poverty of one family,
        an isolated family, sir. Now, if this family was poor, it would
        be due to the limitations of the individual or of the
        environment. Limitations of the individual would cover
        inefficiency, false theory of industry, ill-judged division of
        labor, poor system of production, or misuse of product.
        Limitation of environment would, of course, apply to climate,
        soil, natural products, etc. No amount of health, intelligence
        or virtue could make Iceland rich—if it was completely isolated;
        nor England, for that matter, owing to the inexorable
        limitations of that environment.</p>
        <p>“Here in this country we have no complaint to make of our
        natural resources. The soil is capable of sustaining an enormous
        population. So we have merely to consider the limitations of
        individuals, transferring our problem from the isolated family
        to the general public.</p>
        <p>“What do we find? All the limitations I enumerated!
        Inefficiency—nearly every one below par in working power in the
        generation before last, as well as miserably educated; false
        theories of industry everywhere—idiotic notions as to what work
        was ‘respectable’ and what wasn’t, more idiotic notions of
        payment; worst of all, most idiotic ideas that work was a curse
        . . . Might as well call digestion a curse! Dear! Dear! How
        benighted we were!</p>
        <p>“Then there was ill-judged division of labor—almost
        universal; that evil. For instance, look at this one point; half
        the workers of the world, nearly, were restricted to one class
        of labor, and that in the lowest industrial grade.”</p>
        <p>“He means women, in housework, John,” Nellie interpolated.
        “We never used to think of that as part of our economic
        problem.”</p>
        <p>“It was a very serious part,” the professor continued,
        hastily forestalling the evident intention of Mr. Brown to
        strike in, “but there were many others. The obvious utility of
        natural specialization in labor seemed scarcely to occur to us.
        Our system of production was archaic in the extreme; practically
        no system was followed.”</p>
        <p>“You must give credit to the work of the Department of
        Agriculture, Dr. Harkness,” urged Mr. Brown, “the introduction
        of new fruits, the improvement of stocks”</p>
        <p>“Yes, yes,” agreed Dr. Harkness, “the rudiments were there,
        of course; but no real grasp of organized productivity. And as
        to misuse of product—why, my dear Mr. Robertson, it is a wonder
        anybody had enough to live on in those days, in view of our
        criminal waste.</p>
        <p>“The real turning point, Mr. Robertson, if we can put our
        finger on one, is where the majority of the people recognized
        the folly and evil of poverty—and saw it to be a thing of our
        own making. We saw that our worst poverty was poverty in the
        stock—that we raised a terrible percentage of poor people. Then
        we established a temporary Commission on Human Efficiency, away
        back in 1913 or 14”</p>
        <p>“Thirteen,” put in Mr. Pike, who sat back listening to
        Dr. Harkness with an air of repressed superiority.</p>
        <p>“Thank you,” said the eminent sociologist courteously. “These
        young fellows have it all at their fingers’ ends, Mr. Robertson.
        Better methods in education nowadays, far better! As I was
        saying, we established a Commission on Human Efficiency.”</p>
        <p>“You will remember the dawning notions of ‘scientific
        management’ we began to have in the first decade of the new
        century,” Mrs. Allerton quietly suggested. “It occurred to us
        later to apply it to ourselves—and we did.”</p>
        <p>“The Commission found that the majority of human beings were
        not properly reared,” Dr. Harkness resumed, “with a resultant
        low standard of efficiency—shockingly low; and that the loss was
        not merely to the individual but to the community. Then Society
        stretched out a long arm and took charge of the work of
        humaniculture—began to lift the human standard.</p>
        <p>“I won’t burden you with details on that line at present; it
        touched but one cause of poverty after all. The false theory of
        industry was next to be changed. A few far-seeing persons were
        already writing and talking about work as an organic social
        function, but the sudden spread of it came through the new
        religion.”</p>
        <p>“And the new voters, Dr. Harkness,” my sister added.</p>
        <p>He smiled at her benevolently. A large, comfortable,
        full-bearded, rosy old gentleman was Dr. Harkness, and evidently
        in full enjoyment of his present task.</p>
        <p>“Let us never forget the new voters, of course. They have
        ceased to be thought of as new, Mr. Robertson—so easily does the
        human mind accept established conditions. The new religion urged
        work—normal, well-adapted work—as the duty of life—as life
        itself; and the new voters accepted this idea as one woman.</p>
        <p>“They were, as a class, used to doing their duty in patient
        industry, generally distasteful to them; and the opportunity of
        doing work they liked—with a sense of higher duty added—was
        universally welcomed.”</p>
        <p>“I certainly remember a large class of women who practiced no
        industry at all—no duty, either, unless what they called ‘social
        duties.’” I rather sourly remarked. Mrs. Allerton took me up
        with sudden heat:</p>
        <p>“Yes, there were such, in large numbers, in our great cities
        particularly; but public opinion was rising against them even as
        far back as 1910. The more progressive women turned the light on
        them first, and then men took it up and began to see that this
        domestic pet was not only expensive and useless but injurious
        and absurd. I don’t suppose we can realize,” she continued
        meditatively,</p>
        <p>“how complete the change in public opinion is—and how
        supremely important. In visible material progress we have only
        followed simple lines, quite natural and obvious, and
        accomplished what was perfectly possible at any time—if we had
        only thought so.”</p>
        <p>“That’s the point!” Mr. Pike was unable to preserve his air
        of restraint any longer, and burst forth volubly.</p>
        <p>“That was the greatest, the most sudden, the most vital of
        our changes, sir—the: change in the world’s thought! Ideas are
        the real things, sir! Brick and mortar? Bah! We can put brick
        and mortar in any shape we choose—but we have to choose first!
        What held the old world back was not facts—not conditions—not
        any material limitations, or psychic limitations either. We had
        every constituent of human happiness, sir—except the sense to
        use them. The channel of progress was obstructed with a deposit
        of prehistoric ideas. We choked up our children’s minds with
        this mental refuse as we choked our rivers and harbors with
        material refuse, sir.”</p>
        <p>Dr. Harkness still smiled. “Mr. Pike was in my class ten
        years ago,” he observed amiably. “I always said he was the
        brightest young man I had. We are all very proud of
        Mr. Pike.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Pike seemed not over pleased with this communication, and
        the old gentleman went on:</p>
        <p>“He is entirely right. Our idiotic ideas and theories were
        the main causes of poverty after all. The new views on
        economics—true social economics, not the ‘dismal science’; with
        the blaze of the new religion to show what was right and wrong,
        and the sudden uprising of half the adult world—the new
        voters—to carry out the new ideas; these were what changed
        things! There you have it, Mr. Robertson, in a nutshell—rather a
        large nutshell, a pericarp, as it were—but I think that covers
        it.”</p>
        <p>“We students used always to admire Dr. Harkness’ power of
        easy generalization,” said Mr. Pike, in a mild, subacid tone,
        “but if any ground of inquiry is left to you, Mr. Robertson, I
        could, perhaps, illuminate some special points.”</p>
        <p>Dr. Harkness laughed in high good humor, and clapped his
        whilom pupil on the back.</p>
        <p>“You have the floor, Mr. Pike—I shall listen to you with
        edification.”</p>
        <p>The young man looked a little ashamed of his small irony, and
        continued more genially:</p>
        <p>“Our first step—or one of our first steps, for we advanced
        like a strenuous centipede—was to check the birth of defectives
        and degenerates. Certain classes of criminals and perverts were
        rendered incapable of reproducing their kind. In the matter of
        those diseases most injurious to the young, very stringent
        measures were taken. It was made a felony to infect wife or
        child knowingly, and a misdemeanor if it were done unknowingly.
        Physicians were obliged to report all cases of infectious
        disease, and young girls were clearly taught the consequence of
        marriage with infected persons. The immediate result was, of
        course, a great decrease in marriage; but the increase in
        population was scarce checked at all because of the lowered
        death rate among children. It was checked a little; but for
        twenty years now, it has been recovering itself. We increase a
        little too fast now, but see every hope of a balanced population
        long before the resources of the world are exhausted.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown seized upon a second moment’s pause to suggest that
        the world’s resources were vastly increased also—and still
        increasing.</p>
        <p>“Let Pike rest a moment and get his breath,” he said, warming
        to the subject, “I want to tell Mr. Robertson that the
        productivity of the earth is gaining every year. Here’s this old
        earth feeding us all—laying golden eggs as it were; and we used
        to get those eggs by the Caesarian operation! We uniformly
        exhausted the soil—uniformly! Now a man would no more think of
        injuring the soil, the soil that feeds him, than he would of
        hurting his mother. We steadily improve the soil; we improve the
        seed; we improve methods of culture; we improve everything.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Allerton struck in here, “Not forgetting the methods of
        transportation, Mr. Robertson. There was one kind of old world
        folly which made great waste of labor and time; that was our
        constant desire to eat things out of season. There is now a
        truer sense of what is really good eating; no one wants to eat
        asparagus that is not of the best, and asparagus cut five or ten
        days cannot be really good. We do not carry things about
        unnecessarily; and the carrying we do is swift, easy and
        economical. For slow freight we use waterways wherever
        possible—you will be pleased to see the ‘all-water routes’ that
        thread the country now. And our roads—you haven’t seen our roads
        yet! We lead the world.”</p>
        <p>“We used to be at the foot of the class as to roads, did we
        not?” I asked; and Mr. Pike swiftly answered:</p>
        <p>“We did, indeed, sir. But that very need of good roads made
        easy to us the second step in abolishing poverty. Here was a
        great social need calling for labor; here were thousands of men
        calling for employment; and here were we keeping the supply from
        the demand by main strength—merely from those archaic ideas of
        ours.</p>
        <p>“We had a mass of valuable data already collected, and now
        that the whole country teemed with new ideals of citizenship and
        statesmanship, it did not take very long to get the two
        together.”</p>
        <p>“We furnished employment for all the women, too,” my sister
        added. “A Social Service Union was formed the country over; it
        was part of the new religion. Every town has one—men and women.
        The same spirit that used to give us crusaders and missionaries
        now gave plenty of enthusiastic workers.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t see yet how you got up any enthusiasm about work,”
        said I.</p>
        <p>“It was not work for oneself,” Nellie explained. “That is
        what used to make it so sordid; we used really to believe that
        we were working each for himself. This new idea was overwhelming
        in its simplicity—and truth; work is social service—social
        service is religion—that’s about it.”</p>
        <p>“Not only so,” Dr. Harkness added, “it made a three-fold
        appeal; to the old, deep-seated religious sense; to the new,
        vivid intellectual acceptance; and to the very wide-spread,
        wholesome appreciation of a clear advantage.</p>
        <p>“When a thing was offered to the world that agreed with every
        social instinct, that appealed to common sense, that was
        established by the highest scientific authority, and that had
        the overwhelming sanction of religion—why the world took to
        it.”</p>
        <p>“But it is surely not natural to people to work—much less to
        like to work!” I protested.</p>
        <p>“There’s where the change comes in,” Mr. Pike eagerly
        explained. “We used to think that people hated work—nothing of
        the sort! What people hated was too much I work, which is death;
        work they were personally unfit for and therefore disliked,
        which is torture; work under improper conditions, which is
        disease; work held contemptible, looked down upon by other
        people, which is a grievous social distress; and work so
        ill-paid that no human beings could really live by it.”</p>
        <p>“Why Mr. Robertson, if you can throw any light on the now
        inconceivable folly of that time so utterly behind us, we shall
        be genuinely indebted to you. It was quite understood in your
        day that the whole world’s life, comfort, prosperity and
        progress depended upon the work done, was it not?”</p>
        <p>“Why, of course; that was an economic platitude,” I
        answered.</p>
        <p>“Then why were the workers punished for doing it?”</p>
        <p>“Punished? What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>“I mean just what I say. They were punished, just as we
        punish criminals—with confinement at hard labor. The great mass
        of the people were forced to labor for cruelly long hours at
        dull, distasteful occupations; is not that punishment?”</p>
        <p>“Not at all,” I said hotly. “They were free at any time to
        leave an occupation they did not like.”</p>
        <p>“Leave it for what alternative?”</p>
        <p>“To take up another,” said I, perceiving that this, after
        all, was not much of an escape.</p>
        <p>“Yes, to take up another under the same heavy conditions, if
        there was any opening; or to starve—that was their freedom.”</p>
        <p>“Well, what would you have?” I asked. “A man must work for
        his living surely.”</p>
        <p>“Remember your economic platitude, Mr. Robertson,”
        Dr. Harkness suggested. “The whole world’s life, comfort,
        prosperity and progress depends upon the work done, you know. It
        was not their living they were working for; it was the
        world’s.”</p>
        <p>“That is very pretty as a sentiment,” I was beginning; but
        his twinkling eye reminded that an economic platitude is not
        precisely sentimental.</p>
        <p>“That’s where the change came,” Mr. Pike eagerly repeated.
        “The idea that each man had to do it for himself kept us blinded
        to the fact that it was all social service; that they worked for
        the world, and the world treated them shamefully—so shamefully
        that their product was deteriorated, markedly deteriorated.”</p>
        <p>“You will be continually surprised, Mr. Robertson, at the
        improvements of our output,” remarked Mr. Brown. “We have
        standards in every form of manufacture, required standards; and
        to label an article in correctly is a misdemeanor.”</p>
        <p>“That was just starting in the pure-food agitation, you
        remember,” my sister put in—“(‘with apple juice containing
        one-tenth of one per cent, of benzoate of soda’).” “And now,”
        Mr. Brown continued, ” ‘all wool’ is all wool; if it isn’t, you
        can have the dealer arrested. Silk is silk, nowadays, and cream
        is cream.”</p>
        <p>“And ‘caveat emptor’ is a dead letter?” “Yes, it is ‘caveat
        vendor’ now. You see, selling goods is public service.”</p>
        <p>“You apply that term quite differently from what it stood for
        in my memory,” said I.</p>
        <p>“It used to mean some sort of beneficent statesmanship, at
        first,” Nellie agreed. “Then it spread to various philanthropic
        efforts and wider grades of government activities. Now it means
        any kind of world work.”</p>
        <p>She saw that this description did not carry much weight with
        me, and added, “Any kind of human work, John; that is, work a
        man gives his whole time to and does not himself consume, is
        world work—is social service.”</p>
        <p>“If a man raises, by his own labor, just enough to feed
        himself—that is working for himself,” Mr. Brown explained, “but
        if he raises more corn than he consumes, he is serving
        humanity.”</p>
        <p>“But he does not give it away,” I urged; “he is paid for
        it.”</p>
        <p>“Well, you paid the doctor who saved your child’s life, but
        the doctor’s work was social service none the less—and the
        teacher’s—anybody’s.”</p>
        <p>“But that kind of work benefits humanity—”</p>
        <p>“Yes, and does it not benefit humanity to eat—to have shoes
        and clothes and houses? John, John, wake up!” Nellie for the
        first time showed impatience with me. But my brother-in-law
        extended a protecting arm.</p>
        <p>Now, Nellie, don’t hurry him. This thing will burst upon him
        all at once. Of course, it’s glaringly plain, but there was a
        time when you and I did not see it either.”</p>
        <p>I was a little sulky. “Well, as far as I gather,” and I took
        out my note book, “people all of a sudden changed all their
        ideas about everything—and your demi-millennium followed.”</p>
        <p>“I wish we could say that,” said Mrs. Allerton. “We axe not
        telling you of our present day problems and difficulties, you
        see. No, Mr. Robertson, we have merely removed our most obvious
        and patently unnecessary difficulties, of which poverty was at
        least the largest.</p>
        <p>“What we did, as we have rather confusedly suggested, I’m
        afraid, was to establish such measures as to insure better
        births, and vastly better environment and education for every
        child. That raised the standard of the people, you see, and
        increased their efficiency. Then we provided employment for
        everyone, under good conditions, and improved the world in two
        ways at once.”</p>
        <p>“And who paid for this universal employment?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Who paid for it before?” she returned promptly.</p>
        <p>“The employer, of course.”</p>
        <p>“Did he? Out of his own private pocket? At a loss to
        himself.”</p>
        <p>“Why, of course not,” I replied, a little nettled. “Out of
        the profits of the business.”</p>
        <p>“And ‘the business’ was the work done by the employees?”</p>
        <p>“Not at all! He did it himself; they only furnished the
        labor.”</p>
        <p>“Could he do it alone—without ‘labor?’ Did he furnish
        employment as a piece of beneficence, outside of his
        business—Ah, Mr. Robertson, surely it is clear that unless a
        man’s labor furnished a profit to his employer, he would not be
        employed. It was on that profit that ‘labor’ was paid—they paid
        themselves. They do now, but at a higher rate.”</p>
        <p>I was annoyed by this clever juggling with the hard facts of
        business.</p>
        <p>“That is very convincing, Mrs. Allerton,” I said with some
        warmth, “but it unfortunately omits certain factors. A lot of
        laborers could make a given article, of course; but they could
        not sell it—and that is where the profit comes in. What good
        would it do the laborer to pile up goods if he could not sell
        them?”</p>
        <p>“And what good would be the ability to sell goods if there
        were none, Mr. Robertson. Of course, I recognize the importance
        of transportation; that is my own line of work, but there must
        be something to transport. As long ago as St. Paul’s day it was
        known that the hand could not say to the foot, ‘I have no need
        of thee.’”</p>
        <p>“To cover that ground more easily, Mr. Robertson,”
        Dr. Harkness explained, “just put down in your digest there that
        Bureaus of Employment were formed all over the country; some at
        first were of individual initiative, but in a few years’ time
        all were in government management. There was a swift and general
        improvement in the whole country. The roads became models to the
        world, the harbors were cleared, canals dug, cities rebuilt,
        bare hills reforested, the value of our national property
        doubled and trebled—all owing to the employment of hitherto
        neglected labor. Out of the general increase of wealth they got
        their share, of course. And where there is work for everyone, at
        good wages, there is no poverty; that’s clearly seen.”</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
        <p>THE country was as astonishing to me as the city—its old
        beauty added to in every direction. They took me about in motor
        cars, motor boats and air ships, on foot and on horseback (the
        only horses now to be found were in the country) . And while I
        speak of horses, I will add that the only dogs and cats I saw,
        or heard, were in the country, too, and not very numerous at
        that. “We’ve changed our views as to ‘pets’ and ‘domestic
        animals,’” Nellie said. “We ourselves are the only domestic
        animals allowed now. Meat eating, as Hallie told you, is
        decreasing every day; but the care and handling of our food
        animals improves even more rapidly. Every city has its municipal
        pastures and dairies, and every village or residence group. By
        the way, I might as well show you one of those last, and get it
        clear in your mind.”</p>
        <p>We were on an air trip in one of the smooth-going, noiseless
        machines commonly used, which opened a new world of delight to
        me. This one held two, with the aviator. I had inquired about
        accidents, and was glad to find that thirty years’ practice had
        eliminated the worst dangers and reared a race of flying
        men.</p>
        <p>“In our educational plan today all the children are given
        full physical development and control,” my sister explained.
        “That goes back to the woman again—the mothers. There was a sort
        of Hellenic revival—a recognition that it was possible for us to
        rear as beautiful human beings as walked in Athens. When women
        were really free of man’s selective discrimination they proved i
        quite educable, and learned to be ashamed of their deformities.
        Then we began to appreciate the human body and to have children
        reared in an atmosphere of lovely form and color, statues and
        pictures all about them, and the new stories—Oh! I haven’t told
        you a thing about them, have I?”</p>
        <p>“No,” I said; “and please don’t. I started out to see the
        country, and your new-fangled ‘residence groups,’ whatever they
        may be, and I refuse to have my mind filled up with educational
        information. Take me on a school expedition another time,
        please.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” she agreed; “but I can tell you more about the
        beasts without distracting your mind, I hope. For one thing, we
        have no longer any menageries.”</p>
        <p>“What?” I cried. “No menageries! How absurd! They were
        certainly educational, and a great pleasure to children—and
        other people.”</p>
        <p>“Our views of education have changed you see,” she replied;
        “and our views of human relation to the animal world; also our
        ideas of pleasure. People do not think it a pleasure now to
        watch animals in pain.”</p>
        <p>“More absurdity! They were not in pain. They were treated
        better than when left wild,” I hotly replied.</p>
        <p>“Imprisonment is never a pleasure,” she answered; “it is a
        terrible punishment. A menagerie is just a prison, not for any
        offense of the inmates, but to gratify men in the indulgence of
        grossly savage impulses. Children, being in the savage period of
        their growth, feel anew the old satisfaction of seeing their
        huge enemies harmless or their small victims helpless and unable
        to escape. But it did no human being any good.”</p>
        <p>“How about the study of these ‘victims’ of yours—the
        scientific value?”</p>
        <p>“For such study as is really necessary to us, or to them,
        some laboratories keep a few. Otherwise, the student goes to
        where the animals live and studies their real habits.”</p>
        <p>“And how much would he learn of wild tigers by following them
        about—unless it was an inside view?”</p>
        <p>“My dear brother, can you mention one single piece of
        valuable information for humanity to be found in the study of
        imprisoned tigers? As a matter of fact, I don’t think there are
        any left by this time; I hope not.”</p>
        <p>“Do you mean to tell me that your new humanitarianism has
        exterminated whole species?”</p>
        <p>“Why not? Would England be pleasant if the gray wolf still
        ran at large? We are now trying, as rapidly as possible, to make
        this world safe and habitable everywhere.”</p>
        <p>“And how about the hunting? Where’s the big game?”</p>
        <p>“Another relic of barbarism. There is very little big game
        left, and very little hunting.”</p>
        <p>I glared at her, speechless. Not that I was ever a hunter
        myself, or even wanted to be; but to have that splendid manly
        sport utterly prevented—it was outrageous I “I suppose this is
        more of the women’s work,” I said at length.</p>
        <p>She cheerfully admitted it. “Yes, we did it. You see, hunting
        as a means of livelihood is even lower than private
        housework—far too wasteful and expensive to be allowed in a
        civilized world. When women left off using skins and feathers,
        that was a great blow to the industry. As to the sport, why, we
        had never greatly admired it, you know—the manly sport of
        killing things for fun—and with our new power we soon made it
        undesirable.”</p>
        <p>I groaned in spirit. “Do you mean to tell me that you have
        introduced legislation against hunting, and found means to
        enforce it?”</p>
        <p>“We found means to enforce it without much legislation,
        John.”</p>
        <p>As for instance?”</p>
        <p>As for instance, in rearing children who saw and heard the
        fullest condemnation of all such primitive cruelty. That is
        another place where the new story-books come in. Why on earth we
        should have fed our children on silly savagery a thousand years
        old, just because they liked it, is more than I can see. We were
        always interfering with their likes and dislikes in other ways.
        Why so considerate in this? We have a lot of splendid writers
        now—first-class ones—making a whole lot of new literature for
        children.”</p>
        <p>“Do leave out your story books. You were telling me how you
        redoubtable females coerced men into giving up hunting.”</p>
        <p>“Mostly by disapproval, consistent and final.”</p>
        <p>This was the same sort of thing Owen had referred to in
        regard to tobacco. I didn’t like it. It gave me a creepy
        feeling, as of one slowly surmounted by a rising tide. “Are
        you—do you mean to tell me, Nellie, that you women are trying to
        make men over to suit yourselves?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. Why not? Didn’t you make women to suit yourselves for
        several thousand years? You bred and trained us to suit your
        tastes; you liked us small, you liked us weak, you liked us
        timid, you liked us ignorant, you liked us pretty—what you
        called pretty—and you eliminated the kinds you did not
        like.”</p>
        <p>“How, if you please?”</p>
        <p>“By the same process we use—by not marrying them. Then, you
        see, there aren’t any more of that kind.”</p>
        <p>“You are wrong, Nellie—you’re absurdly wrong. Women were
        naturally that way; that is, womanly women were, and men
        preferred that kind, of course.”</p>
        <p>“How do you know women were ‘naturally’ like that?—without
        special education and artificial selection, and all manner of
        restrictions and penalties? Where were any women ever allowed to
        grow up ‘naturally’ until now?”</p>
        <p>I maintained a sulky silence, looking down at the lovely
        green fields and forests beneath. “Have you exterminated dogs?”
        I asked.</p>
        <p>“Not yet. There are a good many real dogs left. But we don’t
        make artificial ones any more.”</p>
        <p>“I suppose you keep all the cats—being women.” She
        laughed.</p>
        <p>“No; we keep very few. Cats kill birds, and we need the birds
        for our farms and gardens. They keep the insects down.”</p>
        <p>“Do they keep the mice down, too?”</p>
        <p>“Owls and night-hawks do, as far as they can. But we attend
        to the mice ourselves. Concrete construction and the removal of
        the kitchen did that. We do not live in food warehouses now.
        There, look! We are coming to Westholm Park; that was one of the
        first.”</p>
        <p>In all the beauty spread below me, the great park showed more
        beautiful, outlined by a thick belt of trees.</p>
        <p>We kept our vehicle gliding slowly above it while Nellie
        pointed things out. “It’s about 300 acres,” she said. “You can
        see the woodland and empty part—all that is left wild. That big
        patch there is pasturage—they keep their own sheep and cows.
        There are gardens and meadows. Up in the corner is the
        children’s playground, bathing pool, and special buildings. Here
        is the playground for grown-ups—and their lake. This big
        spreading thing is the guest house and general playhouse for the
        folks—ballroom, billiards, bowling, and so on. Behind it is the
        plant for the whole thing. The water tower you’ll see to more
        advantage when we land. And all around you see the homes; each
        family has an acre or so.”</p>
        <p>We dropped softly to the landing platform and came down to
        the pleasure ground beneath. In a little motor we ran about the
        place for awhile, that I might see the perfect roads, shaded
        with arching trees, the endless variety of arrangement, the
        miles of flowers, the fruit on every side.</p>
        <p>“You must have had a good landscape architect to plan this,”
        I suggested.</p>
        <p>“We did—one of the best.”</p>
        <p>“It’s not so very unlike a great, first-class summer hotel,
        with singularly beautiful surroundings.”</p>
        <p>“No, it’s not,” she agreed. “We had our best summer resorts
        in mind when we began to plan these places. People used to pay
        heavily in summer to enjoy a place where everything was done to
        make life smooth and pleasant. It occurred to us at last that we
        might live that way.”</p>
        <p>“Who wants to live in a summer hotel all the time? Excuse
        me!”</p>
        <p>“O, they don’t. The people here nearly all live in
        ‘homes’—the homiest kind—each on its own ground, as you see.
        Only some unattached ones, and people who really like it, live
        in the hotel—with transients, of course. Let’s call here; I know
        this family.”</p>
        <p>She introduced me to Mrs. Masson, a sweet, motherly little
        woman, rocking softly on her vine-shadowed piazza, a child in
        her arms. She was eager to tell me about things—most people
        were, I found.</p>
        <p>“I’m a reactionary, Mr. Robertson. I prefer to work at home,
        and I prefer to keep my children with me, all I can.”</p>
        <p>“Isn’t that allowed nowadays?” I inquired.</p>
        <p>“O, yes; if one qualifies. I did. I took the child-culture
        course, but I do not want to be a regular teacher. My work is
        done right here, and I can have them as well as not, but they
        won’t stay much.”</p>
        <p>Even as she spoke the little thing in her arms whispered
        eagerly to her mother, slipped to the floor, ran out of the
        gate, her little pink legs fairly twinkling, and joined an older
        child who was passing.</p>
        <p>“They like to be with the others, you see. This is my baby; I
        manage to hold on to her for part of the day, but she’s always
        running off to The Garden when she can.”</p>
        <p>“The Garden?”</p>
        <p>“Yes; it’s a regular Child Garden, where they are cultivated
        and grow! And they do so love to growl”</p>
        <p>She showed us her pretty little house and her lovely
        work—embroidery. “I’m so fortunate,” she said, “loving home as I
        do, to have work that’s just as well done here.”</p>
        <p>I learned that there were some thirty families living in the
        grounds, not counting the hotel people. Quite a number found
        their work in the necessary activities of the place itself.</p>
        <p>“We have a long string of places, you see—from the general
        manager to the gardeners and dairymen. It is really quite a
        piece of work, to care for some two hundred and fifty people,”
        Mrs. Masson explained with some pride.</p>
        <p>“Instead of a horde of servants and small tradesmen to make a
        living off these thirty families, we have a small corps of
        highly trained officers,” added Nellie.</p>
        <p>“And do you cooperate in housekeeping?” I inquired, meaning
        no harm, though my sister was quite severe with me for this
        slip.</p>
        <p>“No, indeed,” protested Mrs. Masson. “I do despise being
        mixed up with other families. I’ve been here nearly a year, and
        I hardly know anyone.” And she rocked back and forth,
        complacently.</p>
        <p>“But I thought that the meals were cooperative.”</p>
        <p>“O, not at all—not at edit Just see my dining-room! And you
        must be tired and hungry, now, Mrs. Robertson—don’t say no! I’ll
        have lunch in a moment. Excuse me, please.”</p>
        <p>She retired to the telephone, but we could hear her ordering
        lunch. “Right away, please; No. 5; no, let me see—No. 7, please.
        And have you fresh mushrooms? Extra; four plates.”</p>
        <p>Her husband came home in time for the meal, and she presided
        just like any other little matron over a pretty table and a
        daintily served lunch; but it came down from the hotel in a
        neat, light case, to which the remnants and the dishes were
        returned.</p>
        <p>“O, I wouldn’t give up my own table for the world! And my own
        dishes; they take excellent care of them. Our breakfasts we get
        all together—see my kitchen!” And she proudly exhibited a small,
        light closet, where an immaculate porcelain sink, with hot and
        cold water, a glass-doored “cold closet” and a shining electric
        stove, allowed the preparation of many small meals.</p>
        <p>Nellie smiled blandly as she saw this little lady claiming
        conservatism in what struck me as being quite sufficiently
        progressive, while Mr. Masson smiled in proud content.</p>
        <p>“I took you there on purpose,” she told me later. “She is
        really quite reactionary for nowadays, and not over popular.
        Come and see the guest-house.”</p>
        <p>This was a big, wide-spread concrete building, with terraces
        and balconies and wide roofs, where people strolled and sat. It
        rose proudly from its wide lawns and blooming greenery, a
        picture of peace and pleasure.</p>
        <p>“It’s like a country club, with more sleeping rooms,” I
        suggested. “But isn’t it awfully expensive—the year round?”</p>
        <p>“It’s about a third cheaper than it would cost these people
        to live if they kept house. Funny! It took nearly twenty years
        to prove that organization in housekeeping paid, like any other
        form of organized labor. Wages have risen, all the work is
        better done and it costs much less. You can see all that. But
        what you can’t possibly realize is the difference it makes to
        women. All the change the men feel is in better food, no fret
        and worry at home, and smaller bills.”</p>
        <p>“That’s something,” I modestly suggested.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s a good deal; but to the women it’s a thousand
        times more. The women who liked that kind of work are doing it
        now, as a profession, for reasonable hours and excellent
        salaries; and the women who did not like it are now free to do
        the work they are fitted for and enjoy. This is one of our great
        additions to the world’s wealth—freeing so much productive
        energy. It has improved our health, too. One of the worst causes
        of disease is mal-position, you know. Almost everybody used to
        work at what they did not like—and we thought it was beneficial
        to character!”</p>
        <p>I tried without prejudice to realize the new condition, but a
        house without a house-wife, without children, without servants,
        seemed altogether empty. Nellie reassured me as to the children,
        however.</p>
        <p>“It’s no worse than when they went to school, John, not a
        bit. If you were here at about 9 A. M., you’d see the mothers
        taking a morning walk, or ride if it’s stormy, to the
        child-garden, and leaving the babies there, asleep mostly. There
        are seldom more than five or six real little ones at one time in
        a group like this.”</p>
        <p>“Do mothers leave their nursing babies there?”</p>
        <p>“Sometimes; it depends on the kind of work they do. Remember
        they only have to work two hours, and many mothers get ahead on
        their work and take a year off at baby time. Still, two hours’
        work a day that one enjoys, does not hurt even a nursing
        mother.”</p>
        <p>I found it extremely difficult from the first, to picture a
        world whose working day was but two hours long; or even the four
        hours they told me was generally given.</p>
        <p>“What do people do with the rest of their time; working
        people, I mean?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“The old ones usually rest a good deal, loaf, visit one
        another, play games, in some cases they travel. Others, who have
        the working habit ingrained, keep on in the afternoon; in their
        gardens often; almost all old people love gardening; and those
        who wish, have one now, you see. The city ones do an astonishing
        amount of reading, studying, going to lectures, and the
        theatres. They have a good time.”</p>
        <p>“But I mean the low rowdy common people—don’t they merely
        loaf and get drunk?”</p>
        <p>Nellie smiled at me good humoredly.</p>
        <p>“Some of them did, for a while. But it became increasingly
        difficult to get drunk. You see, their health was better, with
        sweeter homes, better food and more pleasure; and except for the
        dipsomaniacs they improved in their tastes presently. Then their
        children all made a great advance, under the new educational
        methods; the women had an immense power as soon as they were
        independent; and between the children’s influence and the
        woman’s and the new opportunities, the worst men had to grow
        better. There was always more recuperative power in people than
        they were given credit for.”</p>
        <p>“But surely there were thousands, hundreds of thousands, of
        hoboes and paupers; wretched, degenerate creatures.”</p>
        <p>Nellie grew sober. “Yes, there were. One of our inherited
        handicaps was that great mass of wreckage left over from the
        foolishness and ignorance of the years behind us. But we dealt
        very thoroughly with them. As I told you before, hopeless
        degenerates were promptly and mercifully removed. A large class
        of perverts were incapacitated for parentage and placed where
        they could do no harm, and could still have some usefulness and
        some pleasure. Many proved curable, and were cured. And for the
        helpless residue; blind and crippled through no fault of their
        own, a remorseful society provides safety, comfort and care;
        with all the devices for occupation and enjoyment that our best
        minds could arrange. These are our remaining asylums; decreasing
        every year. We don’t make that kind of people any more.”</p>
        <p>We talked as we strolled about, or sat on the stone benches
        under rose bush or grape vine. The beauty of the place grew on
        me irresistibly. Each separate family could do as they liked in
        their own yard, under some restriction from the management in
        regard to general comfort and beauty. I was always ready to cry
        out about interference with personal rights; but my sister
        reminded me that we were not allowed to “commit a nuisance” in
        the old days, only our range of objections had widened. A
        disagreeable noise is now prohibited, as much as a foul smell;
        and conspicuously ugly forms and colors, also.</p>
        <p>“And who decides—who’s your dictator and censor?”</p>
        <p>“Our best judges—we elect, recall and change them. But under
        their guidance we have developed some general sense of beauty.
        People would complain loudly now of what did not use to trouble
        them at all.”</p>
        <p>Then I remembered that I had seen no row of wooden cows in
        the green meadows, no invitation to “meet me at the fountain,”
        no assailing finger to assure me that my credit was good, no
        gross cathartic reminders, nothing anywhere to mar the beauty of
        the landscape; but many a graceful gate, temple-like summer
        houses crowning the grassy hills, arbors, pergolas, cool seats
        by stone-rimmed fountains, signs everywhere of the love of
        beauty and the power to make it.</p>
        <p>“I don’t see yet how you ever manage to pay for all this
        extra work everywhere. I suppose in a place like this it comes
        out of the profit made on food,” I suggested.</p>
        <p>“No—the gardening expenses of these home clubs come out of
        the rent.”</p>
        <p>“And what rent do they have to pay—approximately?”</p>
        <p>“I can tell you exactly about this place, because it was
        opened by a sort of stock company of women, and I was in it for
        a while. The land cost $100.00 an acre then—$30,000.00. To get
        it in shape cost $10,000.00, to build thirty of these houses
        about $4,000.00 apiece—there was great saving in doing it all at
        one time, the guest-house, furnished, was only $50,000.00, it is
        very simple, you see; and the general plant and child-garden,
        and everything else, some $40,000.00 more. I know we raised a
        capital of $250,000.00, and used it all. The residents pay
        $600.00 a year for house-rent and $100.00 more for club
        privileges. That is $28,000.00. We take 4 per cent, and it
        leaves plenty for taxes and up-keep. Those who have children
        keep up the child-garden. The hotel makes enough to keep
        everything going easily, and the food and service departments
        pay handsomely. Why, if these people had kept on living in New
        York, it would have cost them altogether at least $8,000.00 a
        year. Here it just costs them about $2,000.00—and just see what
        they get for it.”</p>
        <p>I had an inborn distrust of my sister’s figures, and
        consulted Owen later; also Hallie, who had much detailed
        knowledge on the subject; and furthermore I did some
        reading.</p>
        <p>There was no doubt about it. The method of living of which we
        used to be so proud, for which I still felt a deep longing, was
        abominably expensive. Much smaller amounts, wisely administered,
        produced better living, and for the life of me I could not
        discover the cackling herds of people I had been led to expect
        when such “Utopian schemes” used to be discussed in my
        youth.</p>
        <p>From the broad, shady avenues of this quiet place we looked
        over green hedges or wire fences thick with honeysuckle and
        rose, into pleasant homelike gardens where families sat on broad
        piazzas, swung in hammocks, played tennis, ball, croquet,
        tether-ball and badminton, just as families used to.</p>
        <p>Groups of young girls or young men—or both—strolled under the
        trees and disported themselves altogether as I remembered them
        to have done, and happy children frolicked about in the houses
        and gardens, all the more happily, it would appear, because they
        had their own place for part of the day.</p>
        <p>We had seen the fathers come home in time for the noon meal.
        In the afternoon most of the parents seemed to think it the
        finest thing in the world to watch their children learning or
        playing together, in that amazing Garden of theirs, or to bring
        them home for more individual companionship. As a matter of
        fact, I had never seen, in any group of homes that I could
        recall, so much time given to children by so many parents—unless
        on a Sunday in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>I was very silent on the way back, revolving these things in
        my mind. Point by point it seemed so vividly successful, so
        plainly advantageous, so undeniably enjoyed by those who lived
        there; and yet the old objections surged up continually.</p>
        <p>The “noisy crowd all herding together to eat!”—I remembered
        Mr. Masson’s quiet dining-room—they all had dining-rooms, it
        appeared. The “dreadful separation of children from their
        parents!” I thought of all those parents watching with
        intelligent interest their children’s guarded play, or enjoying
        their companionship at home.</p>
        <p>The “forced jumble with disagreeable neighbors!” I recalled
        those sheltered quiet grounds; each house with its trees and
        lawn, its garden and its outdoor games.</p>
        <p>It was against all my habits, principles, convictions,
        theories, and sentiments; but there it was, and they seemed to
        like it. Also, Owen assured me, it paid.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
        <p>AFTER all, it takes time for a great change in world-thought
        to strike in. That’s what Owen insisted on calling it. He
        maintained that the amazing up-rush of these thirty years was
        really due to the wholesale acceptance and application of the
        idea of evolution.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know which to call more important—the new idea, or
        the new power to use it,” he said. “When we were young,
        practically all men of science accepted the evolutionary theory
        of life; and it was in general popular favor, though little
        understood. But the governing ideas of all our earlier time were
        so completely out of touch with life; so impossible of any
        useful application, that the connection between belief and
        behavior was rusted out of us. Between our detached religious
        ideas and our brutal ignorance of brain culture, we had made
        ourselves preternaturally inefficient.</p>
        <p>“Then—you remember the talk there was about Mental
        Healing—‘Power in Repose’—‘The Human Machine’—or was that a bit
        later? Anyway, people had begun to waken up to the fact that
        they could do things with their brains. At first they used them
        only to cure diseases, to maintain an artificial ‘peace of
        mind,’ and tricks like that. Then it suddenly burst upon us—two
        or three important books came along nearly at once, and hosts of
        articles—that we could use this wonderful mental power every
        day, to live with! That all these scientific facts and laws had
        an application to life—human life.”</p>
        <p>I nodded appreciatively. I was getting quite fond of my
        brother-in-law. We were in a small, comfortable motor boat,
        gliding swiftly and noiselessly up the beautiful Hudson. Its
        blue cleanness was a joy. I could see fish—real fish—in the
        clear water when we were still.</p>
        <p>The banks were one long succession of gardens, palaces,
        cottages and rich woodlands, charming to view.</p>
        <p>“It’s the time that puzzles me more than thing,” I said,
        “even more than the money. How on earth so much could be done in
        so little time!”</p>
        <p>“That’s because you conceive of it as being done in one place
        after another, instead of in every place at once,” Owen replied.
        “If one city, in one year, could end the smoke at once,” Owen
        replied. “If one city, in one year, could end the smoke
        nuisance, so could all the cities on earth, if they chose to. We
        chose to, all over the country, practically at once.”</p>
        <p>“But you speak of evolution. Evolution is the slowest of slow
        processes. It took us thousands of dragging years to evolve the
        civilization of 1910, and you show me a 1940 that seems
        thousands of years beyond that.”</p>
        <p>“Yes; but what you call Evolution’ was that of unaided
        nature. Social evolution is a distinct process. Below us, you
        see, all improvements had to be built into the stock—transmitted
        by heredity. The social organism is open to lateral
        transmission—what we used to call education. We never understood
        it. We thought it was to supply certain piles of information,
        mostly useless; or to develop certain qualities.”</p>
        <p>“And what do you think it is now?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“We know now that the social process is to constantly improve
        and develop society. This has a necessary corollary of
        improvement in individuals; but the thing that matters most is
        growth in the social spirit—and body.”</p>
        <p>“You’re beyond me now, Owen.”</p>
        <p>“Yes; don’t you notice that ever since you began to study our
        advance, what puzzles you most is not the visible details about
        you, but a changed spirit in people? Thirty years ago, if you
        showed a man that some one had dumped a ton of soot in his front
        yard he would have been furious, and had the man arrested and
        punished. If you showed him that numbers of men were dumping
        thousands of tons of soot all over his city every year, he would
        have neither felt nor acted. It’s the other way, now.”</p>
        <p>“You speak as if man had really learned to ‘love his neighbor
        as himself,’” I said sarcastically.</p>
        <p>“And why not? If you have a horse, on whose strength you
        absolutely depend to make a necessary journey, you take good
        care of that horse and grow fond of him. It dawned on us at last
        that life was not an individual affair; that other people were
        essential to our happiness—to our very existence. We are not
        what they used to call ‘altruistic’ in this. We do not think of
        ‘neighbors,’ ‘brothers,’ ‘others’ any more. It is all
        ‘ourself.’”</p>
        <p>“I don’t follow you—sorry.”</p>
        <p>Owen grinned at me amiably. “No matter, old chap, you can see
        results, and will have to take the reasons on trust. Now here’s
        this particular river with its natural beauties, and its
        unnatural defilements. We simply stopped defiling it—and one
        season’s rain did the rest.”</p>
        <p>“Did the rains wash away the rail-roads?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no—they are there still. But the use of electric power
        has removed the worst evils. There is no smoke, dust, cinders,
        and a yearly saving of millions in forest fires on the side!
        Also very little noise. Come and see the way it works now.”</p>
        <p>We ran in at Yonkers. I wouldn’t have known the old town. It
        was as beautiful as—Posilippo.”</p>
        <p>“Where are the factories?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“There—and there—and there.”</p>
        <p>“Why, those are palaces!”</p>
        <p>“Well? Why not? Why shouldn’t people work in palaces? It
        doesn’t cost any more to make a beautiful building than an ugly
        one. Remember, we are much richer, now—and have plenty of time,
        and the spirit of beauty is encouraged.”</p>
        <p>I looked at the rows of quiet, stately buildings; wide
        windowed; garden-roofed.</p>
        <p>“Electric power there too?” I suggested.</p>
        <p>Owen nodded again. “Everywhere,” he said. “We store
        electricity all the time with wind-mills, water-mills,
        tide-mills, solar engines—even hand power.”</p>
        <p>“What!”</p>
        <p>“I mean it,” he said. “There are all kinds of storage
        batteries now. Huge ones for mills, little ones for houses; and
        there are ever so many people whose work does not give them
        bodily exercise, and who do not care much for games. So we have
        both hand and foot attachments; and a vigorous man, or woman—or
        child, for that matter, can work away for half an hour, and have
        the pleasant feeling that the power used will heat the house or
        run the motor.</p>
        <p>“Is that why I don’t smell gasoline in the streets?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. We use all those sloppy, smelly things in special
        places—and apply all the power by electric storage mostly. You
        saw the little batteries in our boat.”</p>
        <p>Then he showed me the railroad. There were six tracks, clean
        and shiny—thick turf between them.</p>
        <p>“The inside four are for the special trains—rapid transit and
        long distance freight. The outside two are open to anyone.”</p>
        <p>We stopped long enough to see some trains go by; the express
        at an incredible speed, yet only buzzing softly; and the fast
        freight; cars seemingly of aluminum, like a string of silver
        beads.</p>
        <p>“We use aluminum for almost everything. You know it was only
        a question of power—the stuff is endless,” Owen explained.</p>
        <p>And all the time, on the outside tracks, which had a side
        track at every station, he told me, ran single coaches or short
        trains, both passenger and freight, at a comfortable speed.</p>
        <p>“All kinds of regular short-distance traffic runs this way.
        It’s a great convenience. But the regular highroads are the
        best. Have you noticed?”</p>
        <p>I had seen from the air-motor how broad and fine they looked,
        but told him I had made no special study of them.</p>
        <p>“Come on—while we’re about it,” he said; and called a little
        car. We ran up the hills to Old Broadway, and along its shaded
        reaches for quite a distance. It was broad, indeed. The center
        track, smooth, firm, and dustless, was for swift traffic of any
        sort, and well used. As the freight wagons were beautiful to
        look at and clean, they were not excluded, and the perfect road
        was strong enough for any load. There were rows of trees on
        either side, showing a good growth, though young yet; then a
        narrower roadway for slower vehicles, on either side a second
        row of trees, the footpaths, and the outside trees. i</p>
        <p>“These are only about twenty-five years old. Don’t you think
        they are doing well?”</p>
        <p>“They are a credit to the National Bureau of Highways and
        Arboriculture that I see you are going to tell me about.”</p>
        <p>“You are getting wise,” Owen answered, with a smile.
        “Yes—that’s what does it. And it furnishes employment, I can
        tell you. In the early morning these roads are alive with
        caretakers. Of course the bulk of the work is done by running
        machines; but there is a lot of pruning and trimming and
        fighting with insects. Among our richest victories in that line
        is the extermination of the gipsy moth—brown tail—elm beetle and
        the rest.”</p>
        <p>“How on earth did you do that?”</p>
        <p>“Found the natural devourer—as we did with the scale pest.
        Also by raising birds instead of killing them; and by swift and
        thorough work in the proper season. We gave our minds to it, you
        see, at last.”</p>
        <p>The outside path was a delightful one, wide, smooth, soft to
        the foot, agreeable in color.</p>
        <p>“What do you make your sidewalk of?” I asked.</p>
        <p>Owen tapped it with his foot. “It’s a kind of semi-flexible
        concrete—wears well, too. And we color it to suit ourselves, you
        see. There was no real reason why a path should be ugly to look
        at.”</p>
        <p>Every now and then there were seats; also of concrete,
        beautifully shaped and too heavy to be easily moved. A narrow
        crack ran along the lowest curve.</p>
        <p>“That keeps ’em dry,” said Owen.</p>
        <p>Drinking fountains bubbled invitingly up from graceful
        standing basins, where birds drank and dipped in the
        overflow.</p>
        <p>“Why, these are fruit trees,” I said suddenly, looking along
        the outside row.</p>
        <p>“Yes, nearly all of them, and the next row are mostly nut
        trees. You see, the fruit trees are shorter and don’t take the
        sun off. The middle ones are elms wherever elms grow well. I
        tell you, John, it is the experience of a lifetime to take a
        long motor trip over the roads of America! You can pick your
        climate, or run with the season. Nellie and I started once from
        New Orleans in February—the violets out. We came north with
        them; I picked her a fresh bunch every day!”</p>
        <p>He showed me the grape vines trained from tree to tree in
        Tuscan fashion; the lines of berry bushes, and the endless
        ribbon of perennial flowers that made the final border of the
        pathway. On its inner side were beds of violets, lilies of the
        valley, and thick ferns; and around each fountain were groups of
        lilies and water-loving plants.</p>
        <p>I shook my head.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it,” I said. “I simply don’t believe it! How
        could any nation afford to keep up such roads!”</p>
        <p>Owen drew me to a seat—we had dismounted to examine a
        fountain and see the flowers. He produced pencil and paper.</p>
        <p>“I’m no expert,” he said. “I can’t give you exact figures.
        But I want you to remember that the trees pay. Pay! These roads,
        hundreds of thousands of miles of them, constitute quite a
        forest, and quite an orchard. Nuts, as Hallie told you, are in
        growing use as food. We have along these roads, as beautiful
        clean shade trees, the finest improved kinds of chestnut,
        walnut, butternut, pecan—whatever grows best in the
        locality.”</p>
        <p>And then he made a number of startling assertions and
        computations, and showed me the profit per mile of two rows of
        well-kept nut trees.</p>
        <p>“I suppose Hallie has told you about tree farming?” he
        added.</p>
        <p>“She said something about it—but I didn’t rightly know what
        she meant.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, it’s a big thing; it has revolutionized agriculture. As
        you’re sailing over the country now you don’t see so many bald
        spots. A healthy, permanent world has to keep its fur on.”</p>
        <p>I was impressed by that casual remark, “As you’re sailing
        over the country.”</p>
        <p>“Look here, Owen, I think I have the glimmer of an idea.
        Didn’t the common use of airships help to develop this social
        consciousness you’re always talking about—this general view of
        things?”</p>
        <p>He clapped me on the shoulder. “You’re dead right, John—it
        did, and I don’t believe any of us would have thought to mention
        it.” He looked at me admiringly. “Behold the power of a
        naturally strong mind—in spite of circumstances! Yes, really
        that’s a fact. You see few people are able to visualize what
        they have not seen. Most of us had no more idea of the surface
        of the earth than an ant has of a meadow. In each mind was only
        a thready fragment of an idea of the world—no real geographic
        view. And when we got flying all over it commonly, it became
        real and familiar to us—like a big garden.</p>
        <p>“I guess that helped on the tree idea. You see, in our
        earlier kind of agriculture the first thing we did was to cut
        down the forest, dig up and burn over, plow, harrow, and brush
        fine—to plant our little grasses. All that dry, soft, naked soil
        was helplessly exposed to the rain—and the rain washed it
        steadily away. In one heavy storm soil that it had taken
        centuries of forest growth to make would be carried off to clog
        the livers and harbors. This struck us all at once as wasteful.
        We began to realize that food could grow on trees as well as
        grasses; that the cubic space occupied by a chestnut tree could
        produce more bushels of nutriment than the linear space below
        it. Of course we have our wheat fields yet, but around every
        exposed flat acreage is a broad belt of turf and trees; every
        river and brook is broadly bordered with turf and trees, or
        shrubs. We have stopped soil waste to a very great extent. Also
        we make soil—but that is a different matter.”</p>
        <p>“Hurrying Mother Nature again, eh?” “Yes, the advance in
        scientific agriculture is steady. Don’t you remember that German
        professor who raised all kinds of things in water? Just fed them
        a pinch of chemicals now and then? They said he had a row of
        trees before his door with their roots in barrels of water—the
        third generation that had never touched ground. We kept on
        studying, and began to learn how to put together the proper kind
        of soil for different kinds of plants. Rock-crushers furnished
        the basis, then add the preferred constituents and sell, by the
        bag or the ship load. You can have a radish bed in a box on your
        window sill, if you like radishes, that will raise you the
        fattest, sweetest, juiciest, crispiest, tenderest little pink
        beauties you ever saw—all the year round. No weed seeds in that
        soil, either.”</p>
        <p>We rolled slowly back in the green shade. There was plenty of
        traffic, but all quiet, orderly, and comfortable. The people
        were a constant surprise to me. They were certainly better
        looking, even the poorest. And on the faces of the newest
        immigrants there was an expression of blazing hope that was
        almost better than the cheery peacefulness of the native
        born.</p>
        <p>Wherever I saw workmen, they worked swiftly, with eager
        interest. Nowhere did I see the sagging slouch, the slow drag of
        foot and dull swing of arm which I had always associated with
        day laborers. We saw men working in the fields—and women, too;
        but I had learned not to lay my neck on the block too
        frequently. I knew that my protest would only bring out
        explanations of the advantage of field work over house work—and
        that women were as strong as men—or thereabouts. But I was
        surprised at their eagerness.</p>
        <p>“They look as busy as a lot of ants on an ant heap,” I
        said.</p>
        <p>“It’s their heap, you see,” Owen answered. “And they are not
        tired—that makes a great difference.”</p>
        <p>“They seem phenomenally well dressed—looks like a scene in an
        opera. Sort of agricultural uniform?”</p>
        <p>“Why not?” Owen was always asking me “why not”—and there
        wasn’t any answer to it. “We used to have hunting suits and
        fishing suits and plumbing suits, and so on. It isn’t really a
        uniform, just the natural working out of the best appointed
        dress for the trade.”</p>
        <p>Again I held my tongue; not asking how they could afford it,
        but remembering the shorter hours, the larger incomes, the more
        universal education.</p>
        <p>We got back to Yonkers, put up the car—these things could be
        hired, I found, for twenty-five cents an hour—and had lunch in a
        little eating place which bore out Hallie’s statement as to the
        high standard of food everywhere. Our meal was twenty-five cents
        for each of us. I saw Owen smile at me, but I refused to be
        surprised. We settled down in our boat again, and pushed
        smoothly up the river.</p>
        <p>“I wish you’d get one thing clear in my mind,” I said at
        last. “Just how did you tackle the liquor question. I haven’t
        seen a saloon—or a drunken man. Nellie said something about
        people’s not wanting to drink any more—but there were several
        millions who did want to, thirty years ago, and plenty of people
        who wanted them to. What were your steps?”</p>
        <p>“The first step was to eliminate the self-interest of the
        dealer—the big business pressure that had to make drunkards.
        That was done in state after state, within a few years, by
        introducing government ownership and management. With that went
        an absolute government guarantee of purity. In five or six years
        there was no bad liquor sold, and no public drinking places
        except government ones.</p>
        <p>“But that wasn’t enough—not by a long way. It wasn’t the love
        of liquor that supported the public house—it was the need of the
        public house itself.”</p>
        <p>I stared rather uncertainly,</p>
        <p>“The meeting place,” he went on. “Men have to get together.
        We have had public houses as long as we have had private ones,
        almost. It is a social need.”</p>
        <p>“A social need with a pretty bad result, it seems to me,” I
        said, “that took men away from their families, leading to all
        manner of vicious indulgence.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, they used to; but that was because only men used them.
        I said a social need, not a masculine one. We have met it in
        this way. Whenever we build private houses—if it is the lowest
        country unit, or the highest city block, we build accommodations
        for living together.</p>
        <p>“Every little village has its Town House, with club rooms of
        all sorts; the people flock together freely, for games, for
        talk, for lectures, and plays, and dances, and sermons—it is
        universal. And in the city—you don’t see a saloon on every
        corner, but you do see almost as many places where you can ‘meet
        a man’ and talk with him on equal ground.”</p>
        <p>“Meet a woman, too?” I suggested.</p>
        <p>“Yes; especially, yes. People can meet, as individuals or in
        groups, freely and frequently, in city or country. But men can
        not flock by themselves in special places provided for their
        special vices—without taking a great deal of extra trouble.”</p>
        <p>“I should think they would take the trouble, then,” said
        I.</p>
        <p>“But why? When there is every arrangement made for a natural
        good time; when you are not overworked, not underfed, not
        miserable and hopeless. When you can drop into a comfortable
        chair and have excellent food and drink in pleasant company; and
        hear good music, or speaking, or reading, or see pictures; or,
        if you like, play any kind of game; swim, ride, fly, do what you
        want to, for change and recreation—why long for liquor in a low
        place?”</p>
        <p>“But the men—the real men, people as they were,” I insisted.
        “You had a world full of drinking men who liked the saloon; did
        you—what do you call it?—eliminate them?”</p>
        <p>A few of them, yes,” he replied gravely; Some preferred it;
        others, thorough-going dipsomaniacs, we gave hospital treatment
        and permanent restraint; they lived and worked and were well
        provided for in places where there was no liquor. But there were
        not many of that kind. Most men drank under a constant pressure
        of conditions driving them to it, and the mere force of
        habit.</p>
        <p>“Just remember that the weight and terror of life is lifted
        off us—for good and all.”</p>
        <p>“Socialism, you mean?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, real socialism. The wealth and power of all of us
        belongs to all of us now. The Wolf is dead.”</p>
        <p>“Other things besides poverty drove a man to drink in my
        time,” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes—and some men continued to drink. I told you there
        was liquor to be had—good liquor, too. And other drug habits
        held on for a while. But we stopped the source of the trouble.
        The old men died off, the younger ones got over it, and the new
        ones—that’s what you don’t realize yet: We make a new kind of
        people now.”</p>
        <p>He was silent, his strong mouth set in a kind smile, his eyes
        looking far up the blue river.</p>
        <p>“Well, what comes next? What’s done it?” I demanded.
        “Religion, education, or those everlasting women?”</p>
        <p>He laughed outright; laughed till the boat rocked,</p>
        <p>“How you do hate to admit that it’s their turn. John! Haven’t
        we had full swing—everything in our hands—for all historic time?
        They have only begun. Thirty years? Why, John, they have done so
        much in these thirty years that the world’s heart is glad at
        last. You don’t know”</p>
        <p>I didn’t know. But I did feel a distinct resentment at being
        treated like an extinct species.</p>
        <p>“They have simply stepped on to an eminence men have been all
        these years building,” I said. “We have done all the hard
        work—are doing it yet, for all I see. We have made it possible
        for them to live at all! We have made the whole civilization of
        the world—they just profit by it. And now you speak as if,
        somehow, they had managed to achieve more than we have!”</p>
        <p>Owen considered a while thoughtfully. “What you say is true.
        We have done a good deal of the work; we did largely make and
        modify our civilization. But if you read some of the newer
        histories” he stopped and looked at me as if I had just
        happened. “Why you don’t know yet, do you? History has been
        rewritten.”</p>
        <p>“You speak as if ‘history’ was a one act play.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t mean it’s all done, of course—but we do have now a
        complete new treatment of the world’s history. Each nation its
        own, some several of them, there’s no dead level of agreement, I
        assure you. But our old androcentric version of life began to be
        questioned about 1910, I think—and new versions appeared, more
        and more of them. The big scholars took it up, there was new
        research work, and now we are not so glib in our assurance that
        we did it all.”</p>
        <p>“You’re getting pretty close to things I used to know
        something about,” I remarked drily.</p>
        <p>“If you knew all that was known, then, you wouldn’t know
        this, John. Don’t you remember what Lester Ward calls ‘the
        illusion of the near’—how the most familiar facts were precisely
        those we often failed to understand? In all our history, ancient
        and modern, we had the underlying assumption that men were the
        human race, the people who did things; and that women—were
        ‘their women.’”</p>
        <p>And precisely what have you lately discovered? That Horatio
        at the bridge was Horatia, after all? That the world was
        conquered by an Alexandra—and a Napoleona?” I laughed with some
        bitterness.</p>
        <p>“No,” said Owen gently, “There is no question about the
        battles—men did the fighting, of course. But we have learned
        that ‘the decisive battles of history’ were not so decisive as
        we thought them. Man, as a destructive agent did modify history,
        unquestionably. What did make history, make civilization, was
        constructive industry. And for many ages women did most of
        that.”</p>
        <p>“Did women build the Pyramids? the Acropolis? the Roads of
        Rome?”</p>
        <p>“No, nor many other things. But they gave the world its first
        start in agriculture and the care of animals; they clothed it
        and fed it and ornamented it and kept it warm; their ceaseless
        industry made rich the simple early cultures. Consider—without
        men, Egypt and Assyria could not have fought—but they could have
        grown rich and wise. Without women—they could have fought until
        the last man died alone—if the food held out.</p>
        <p>“But I won’t bother you with this, John. You’ll get all you
        want out of books better than I can give it. What I set out to
        say was that the most important influence in weeding out
        intemperance was that of the women.”</p>
        <p>I was in a very bad temper by this time, it was disagreeable
        enough to have this—or any other part of it, true; but what I
        could not stand was to see that big hearted man speak of it in
        such a cheerful matter-of-fact way.</p>
        <p>“Have the men of today no pride?” I asked. “How can you stand
        it—being treated as inferiors—by women?”</p>
        <p>“Women stood it for ten thousand years,” he answered, “being
        treated as inferiors—by men.”</p>
        <p>We went home in silence.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
        <p>I LEARNED to understand the immense material prosperity of
        the country much more easily than its social progress.</p>
        <p>The exquisite agriculture which made millions of acres from
        raw farms and ranches into rich gardens, the forestry which had
        changed our straggling woodlands into great tree-farms, yielding
        their steady crops of cut boughs, thinned underbrush, and
        full-grown trunks, those endless orchard roads, with their
        processions of workers making continual excursions in their
        special cars, keeping roadway and bordering trees in perfect
        order—all this one could see.</p>
        <p>There were, of course far more of the wilder, narrower roads,
        perfect as the road-bed, but not parked, with all untrimmed
        nature to travel through.</p>
        <p>The airships did make a difference. To look down on the
        flowing, outspread miles beneath gave a sense of the unity and
        continuous beauty of our country, quite different from the
        streak views we used to get. An airship is a moving
        mountain-top.</p>
        <p>The cities were even more strikingly beautiful, in that the
        change was greater, the contrast sharper. I never tired of
        wandering about on foot along the streets of cities, and I
        visited several, finding, as Nellie said, that it took no longer
        to improve twenty than one; the people in each could do it as
        soon as they chose to.</p>
        <p>But what made them choose? What had got into the people? That
        was what puzzled me most. It did not show outside, like the
        country changes, and the rebuilt cities; the people did not look
        remarkable, though they were different, too. I watched and
        studied them, trying to analyze the changes that could be seen.
        Most visible was cleanliness, comfort, and beauty in dress.</p>
        <p>I had never dreamed of the relief to the spectator in not
        seeing any poverty. We were used to it, of course; we had our
        excuses, religious and economic, we even found, or thought we
        found, artistic pleasure in this social disease. But now I
        realized what a nightmare it had been—the sights, the sounds,
        the smells of poverty—merely to an outside observer.</p>
        <p>These people had good bodies, too. They were not equally
        beautiful, by any means; thirty years, of course, could not
        wholly return to the normal a race long stunted and overworked.
        But in the difference in the young generation I could see at a
        glance the world’s best hope, that the “long inheritance” is far
        deeper than the short.</p>
        <p>Those of about twenty and under, those who were born after
        some of these changes had been made, were like another race.
        Big, sturdy, blooming creatures, boys and girls alike, swift and
        graceful, eager, happy, courteous—I supposed at first that these
        were the children of exceptionally placed people; but soon
        found, with a heart-stirring sort of shock, that all the
        children were like that.</p>
        <p>Some of the old folk still carried the scars of earlier
        conditions, but the children were new people.</p>
        <p>Then of my own accord I demanded reasons. Nellie laughed
        sweetly.</p>
        <p>“I’m so glad you’ve come to your appetite,” she said. “I’ve
        been longing to talk to you about that, and you were always
        bored.”</p>
        <p>“It’s a good deal of a dose, Nell; you’ll admit that. And one
        hates to be forcibly fed. But now I do want to get an outline, a
        sort of general idea, of what you do with children. Can you
        condense a little recent history, and make it easy to an aged
        stranger?”</p>
        <p>“Aged I You are growing younger every day, John. I believe
        that comparatively brainless life you led in Tibet was good for
        you. That was all new impression on the brain; the first part
        rested. Now you are beginning where you left off. I wish you
        would recognize that.”</p>
        <p>I shook my head. “Never mind me, I’m trying not to think of
        my chopped-off life; but tell me how you manufacture this kind
        of people.”</p>
        <p>My sister sat still, thinking, for a little. “I want to avoid
        repetition if possible—tell me just how much you have in mind
        already.” But I refused to be catechised.</p>
        <p>“You put it all together, straight; I want to get the whole
        of it—as well as I can.”</p>
        <p>“All right. On your head be it. Let me see—first Oh, there
        isn’t any first, John! We were doing ever so much for children
        before you left—before you and I were born! It is the vision of
        all the great child-lovers; that children are people, and the
        most valuable people on earth. The most important thing to a
        child is its mother. We made new mothers for them—I guess that
        is ‘first.’</p>
        <p>“Suppose we begin this way:</p>
        <p>“a. Free, healthy, independent, intelligent mothers.</p>
        <p>“b. Enough to live on—right conditions for child-raising.</p>
        <p>“c. Specialized care.</p>
        <p>“d. The new social consciousness, with its religion, its art,
        its science, its civics, its industry, its wealth, its brilliant
        efficiency. That’s your outline.”</p>
        <p>I set down these points in my notebook.</p>
        <p>“An excellent outline, Nellie. Now for details on ‘a.’ I will
        set my teeth till that’s over.”</p>
        <p>My sister regarded me with amused tenderness. “How you do
        hate the new women, John—in the abstract! I haven’t seen you
        averse to any of them in the concrete!”</p>
        <p>At the time I refused to admit any importance to this remark,
        but I thought it over later—and to good purpose. It was true. I
        did hate the new kind of human being who loomed so large in
        every line of progress. She jarred on every age-old masculine
        prejudice—she was not what woman used to be. And yet—as Nellie
        said—the women I met I liked.</p>
        <p>“Get on with the lesson, my dear,” said I. “I am determined
        to learn and not to argue. What did your omnipresent new woman
        do to improve the human stock so fast?”</p>
        <p>Then Nellie settled down in earnest and gave me all I
        wanted—possibly more.</p>
        <p>“They wakened as if to a new idea, to their own natural duty
        as mothers; to the need of a high personal standard of health
        and character in both parents. That gave us a better start right
        away—clean-born, vigorous children, inheriting strength and
        purity.</p>
        <p>“Then came the change in conditions, a change so great you‘ve
        hardly glimpsed it yet. No more, never more again, please God,
        that brutal hunger and uncertainty, that black devil of want and
        fear. Everybody—everybody—sure of decent living! That one thing
        lifted the heaviest single shadow from the world, and from the
        children.</p>
        <p>“Nobody is overworked now. Nobody is tired, unless they tire
        themselves unnecessarily. People live sanely, safely, easily.
        The difference to children, both in nature and nurture, is very
        great. They all have proper nourishment, and clothing, and
        environment—from birth.</p>
        <p>“And with that, as advance in special conditions for
        child-culture, we build for babies now. We, as a community,
        provide suitably for our most important citizens.”</p>
        <p>At this point I opened my mouth to say something, but
        presently shut it again.</p>
        <p>“Good boy!” said Nellie. “I’ll show you later.”</p>
        <p>“The next is specialized care. That one thing is enough,
        almost, to account for it all. To think of all the ages when our
        poor babies had no benefit at all of the advance in human
        intelligence!</p>
        <p>“We had the best and wisest specialists we could train and
        hire in every other field of life—and the babies left utterly at
        the mercy of amateurs!</p>
        <p>“Well, I mustn’t stop to rage at past history. We do better
        now. John, guess the salary of the head of the Baby Gardens in a
        city.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, call it a million, and go on,” I said cheerfully; which
        somewhat disconcerted her.</p>
        <p>“It’s as big a place as being head of Harvard College,” she
        said, “and better paid than that used to be. Our highest and
        finest people study for this work. Real geniuses, some of them.
        The babies, all the babies, mind you, get the benefit of the
        best wisdom we have. And it grows fast. We are learning by doing
        it. Every year we do better. ’ Growing up’ is an easier process
        than it used to be.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll have to accept it for the sake of argument,” I agreed.
        “It’s the last point I care most for, I think. All these new
        consciousnesses you were so glib about. I guess you can’t
        describe that so easily.”</p>
        <p>She grew thoughtful, rocking to and fro for a few
        moments.</p>
        <p>“No,” she said at length, “it’s not so easy. But I’ll try. I
        wasn’t very glib, really. I spoke of religion, art, civics,
        science, industry, wealth, and efficiency, didn’t I? Now let’s
        see how they apply to the children.</p>
        <p>“This religion Dear me, John! am I to explain the greatest
        sunburst of truth that that ever was—in two minutes?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no,” I said loftily. “I’ll give you five! You’ve got to
        try, anyway.”</p>
        <p>So she tried.</p>
        <p>“In place of Revelation and Belief,” she said slowly, “we now
        have Facts and Knowledge. We used to believe in God—variously,
        and teach the belief as a matter of duty. Now we know God, as
        much as we know anything else—more than we know anything else—it
        is The Fact of Life.</p>
        <p>“This is the base of knowledge, underlying all other
        knowledge, simple and safe and sure—and we can teach it to
        children! The child mind, opening to this lovely world, is no
        longer filled with horrible or ridiculous old ideas—it learns to
        know the lovely truth of life.”</p>
        <p>She looked so serenely beautiful, and sat so still after she
        said this, that I felt a little awkward.</p>
        <p>“I don’t mean to jar on you, Nellie,” I said. “I didn’t know
        you were so—religious.”</p>
        <p>Then she laughed again merrily. “I’m not,” she said. “No more
        than anybody is. We don’t have ‘religious’ people any more,
        John. It’s not a separate thing; a ‘body of doctrine’ and set of
        observances—it is what all of us have at the bottom of
        everything else, the underlying basic fact of life. And it goes
        far, very far indeed, to make the strong good cheer you see in
        these children’s faces.</p>
        <p>“They have never been frightened, John. They have never been
        told any of those awful things we used to tell them. There is no
        struggle with church-going, no gagging over doctrines, no
        mysterious queer mess—only life. Life is now open to our
        children, clear, brilliant, satisfying, and yet stimulating.</p>
        <p>“Of course, I don’t mean that this applies equally to every
        last one. The material benefit does, that could be enforced by
        law where necessary; but this world-wave of new knowledge is
        irregular, of course. It has spread wider, and gone faster than
        any of the old religions ever did, but you can find people yet
        who believe things almost as dreadful as father did!”</p>
        <p>I well remembered my father’s lingering Calvinism, and
        appreciated its horrors.</p>
        <p>“Our educators have recognized a new duty to children,”
        Nellie went on; “to stand between them and the past. We
        recognize that the child mind should lift and lead the world;
        and we feed it with our newest, not our oldest ideas.</p>
        <p>“Also we encourage it to wander on ahead, fearless and happy.
        I began to tell you the other day—and you snubbed me, John, you
        did really!—that we have a new literature for children, and have
        dropped the old.”</p>
        <p>At this piece of information I could no longer preserve the
        attitude of a patient listener. I sat back and stared at my
        sister, while the full awfulness of this condition slowly rolled
        over me.</p>
        <p>“Do you mean,” I said slowly, “that children are taught
        nothing of the past?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no, indeed; they are taught about the past from the
        earth’s beginning. In the mind of every child is a clear view of
        how Life has grown on earth.”</p>
        <p>“And our own history?”</p>
        <p>“Of course; from savagery to today—that is a simple story,
        endlessly interesting as they grow older.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean, then, by cutting off the past?”</p>
        <p>“I mean that their stories, poems, pictures, and the major
        part of their instruction deals with the present and
        future—especially the future. The whole teaching is dynamic—not
        static. We used to teach mostly facts, or what we thought were
        facts. Now we teach processes. You’ll find out if you talk to
        children, anywhere.”</p>
        <p>This I mentally determined to do, and in due course did. I
        may as well say right here that I found children more delightful
        companions than they used to be. They were polite enough, even
        considerate; but so universally happy, so overflowing with
        purposes, so skilful in so many ways, so intelligent and
        efficient, that it astonished me. We used to have a sort of
        race-myth about “happy childhood,” but none of us seemed to
        study the faces of the children we saw about us. Even among
        well-to-do families, the discontented, careworn, anxious,
        repressed, or rebellious faces of children ought to have routed
        our myth forever.</p>
        <p>Timid, brow-beaten children, sulky children, darkly
        resentful; nervous, whining children, foolish, mischievous,
        hysterically giggling children, noisy, destructive, uneasy
        children—how well I remembered them.</p>
        <p>These new ones had a strange air of being Persons, not
        subordinates and dependents, but Equals; their limitations
        frankly admitted, but not cast up at them, and their special
        powers fully respected. That was it!</p>
        <p>I am wandering far ahead of that day’s conversation, but it
        led to wide study among children, analysis, and some interesting
        conclusions. When I hit on this one I began to understand.
        Children were universally respected, and they liked it. In city
        or country, place was made for them, permanent, pleasant,
        properly appointed place; to use, enjoy, and grow up in. They
        had their homes and families as before, losing nothing; but they
        added to this background their own wide gardens and houses,
        where part of each day was spent.</p>
        <p>From earliest infancy they absorbed the idea that home was a
        place to come out from and go back to; the sweetest, dearest
        place—for there was mother, and father, and one’s own little
        room to sleep in; but the day hours were to go somewhere to
        learn and do, to work and play, to grow in.</p>
        <p>I branched off from Nellie’s startling me with her
        “new-literature-for-children” idea. She went on to explain it
        further.</p>
        <p>“The greatest artists work for children now, John,” she said.
        “In the child-gardens and child-homes they are surrounded with
        beauty. I do not mean that we hire painters and poets to
        manufacture beauty for them; but that painters and poets,
        architects and landscape artists, designers and decorators of
        all kinds, love and revere childhood, and delight to work for
        it.</p>
        <p>“Remember that half of our artists are mothers now—a loving,
        serving, giving spirit has come into expression—a wider and more
        lasting expression than it was ever possible to put into
        doughnuts and embroidery! Wait till you see the beauty of our
        child-gardens!”</p>
        <p>“Why don’t you call them schools? Don’t you have
        schools?”</p>
        <p>“Some. We haven’t wholly outgrown the old academic habit. But
        for the babies there was no precedent, and they do not ‘go to
        school.’”</p>
        <p>“You have a sort of central nursery?” I ventured.</p>
        <p>“Not necessarily ‘central,’ John. And we have great numbers
        of them. How can I make it any way clear to you? See here.
        Suppose you were a mother, and a very busy one, like the old
        woman in the shoe; and suppose you had twenty or thirty
        permanent babies to be provided for? And suppose you were wise
        and rich—able to do what you wanted to? Wouldn’t you build an
        elaborate nursery for those children? Wouldn’t you engage the
        very best nurses and teachers? Wouldn’t you want the cleanest,
        quietest garden for them to play or sleep in? Of course you
        would.</p>
        <p>“That is our attitude. We have at last recognized babies as a
        permanent class. They are always here, about a fifth of the
        population. And we, their mothers, have at last ensured to
        these, our babies, the best accommodation known to our time. It
        im proves as we learn, of course.”</p>
        <p>“Mm!” I said. “I’ll go and gaze upon these Infant Paradises
        later—at the sleeping hour, please! But how about that new
        literature you frightened me with?”</p>
        <p>“Oh. Why, we have tried to treat their minds as we do their
        stomachs—putting in only what is good for then. I mean the very
        littlest, understand. As they grow older they have wider range;
        we have not expunged the world’s past, my dear brother! But we
        do prepare with all the wisdom, love, and power we have, the
        mental food for little children. Simple, lovely music is about
        them always—you must have noticed how universally they
        sing?”</p>
        <p>I had, and said so.</p>
        <p>“The coloring and decoration of their rooms is
        beautiful—their clothes are beautiful—and simple—you’ve seen
        that, too?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, dear girl. It’s because I’ve seen—and heard—and noticed
        the surprisingness of the New Child that I sit here fairly
        guzzling information. Pray proceed to the literature.”</p>
        <p>“Literature is the most useful of the arts—the most perfect
        medium for transfer of ideas. We wish to have the first
        impressions in our children’s minds, above all things, true. All
        the witchery and loveliness possible in presentation—but the
        things presented are not senseless and unpleasant.</p>
        <p>“We have plenty of ‘true stories,’ stories based on real
        events and on natural laws and processes; but the viewpoint from
        which they are written has changed; you’ll have to read some to
        see what I mean. But the major difference is in our stories of
        the future, our future here on earth. They are good stories,
        mind, the very best writers make them; good verses and pictures,
        too. And a diet like that, while it is just as varied and
        entertaining as the ‘once upon a time’ kind, leaves the child
        with a sense that things are going to happen—and he, or she, can
        help.</p>
        <p>“You see, we don’t consider anything as done. To you, as a
        new visitor, we ‘point with pride,’ but among ourselves we ‘view
        with alarm.’ We are just as full of Reformers and Propagandists
        as ever, and overflowing with plans for improvement.</p>
        <p>“These are the main characteristics of the new child
        literature: Truth and Something Better Ahead.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t like it!” I said firmly. “No wonder you dodged about
        so long. You‘ve apparently made a sort of pap out of Grad-grind
        and Rollo, and feed it to these poor babies through a tube P</p>
        <p>This time my sister rebelled. She came firmly to my side and
        pulled my hair—precisely as she used to do forty years ago and
        more—the few little hairs at the crown which still troubled me
        in brushing—because of being pulled out straight so often.</p>
        <p>“You shall have no more oral instruction, young man,” said
        she. “You shall be taken about and shown things; you shall
        ‘Stop! Look! Listen!’ until you admit the advantages I have
        striven in vain to pump into your resisting intellect—you
        Product of Past Methods!”</p>
        <p>“You’re the product of the same methods yourself, my dear,” I
        replied amiably; “but I’m quite willing to be shown—always was
        something of a Missourian.”</p>
        <p>No part of my re-education was pleasanter, and I’m sure none
        was more important, than the next few days. We visited place
        after place, in different cities, or in the country, and
        everywhere was the same high standard of health and beauty, of
        comfort, fun, and visible growth.</p>
        <p>I saw babies and wee toddlers by the thousands, and hardly
        ever heard one cry! Out of that mass of experience some vivid
        pictures remain in my mind. One was “mother time” in a
        manufacturing village. There was a big group of mills with
        water-power; each mill a beautiful, clean place, light, airy,
        rich in color, sweet with the flowers about it, where men and
        women worked their two-hour shifts.</p>
        <p>The women took off their work-aprons and slipped into the
        neighboring garden to nurse their babies. They were in no haste.
        They were pleasantly dressed and well-fed and not tired.</p>
        <p>They were known and welcomed by the women in charge of the
        child-garden; and each mother slipped into a comfortable rocker
        and took into her arms that little rosy piece of herself and the
        man she loved—it was a thing to bring one’s heart into one’s
        throat. The clean peace and quiet of it, time enough, the
        pleasant neighborliness, the atmosphere of contented motherhood,
        those healthy, drowsy little mites, so busy with their
        dinner.</p>
        <p>Then they put them down, asleep For the most part, kissed
        them, and strolled back to the pleasant workroom for another two
        hours.</p>
        <p>Specialization used to be a terror, when a whole human being
        was held down to one notion for ten hours. But specialization
        hurts nobody when it does not last too long.</p>
        <p>In the afternoons some mothers took their babies home at
        once. Some nursed them and then went out together for exercise
        or pleasure. The homes were clean and quiet, too; no kitchen
        work, no laundry work, no self-made clutter and dirt. It looked
        so comfortable that I couldn’t believe my eyes, yet it was just
        common, everyday life.</p>
        <p>As the babies grew old enough to move about, their joys
        widened. They were kept in rooms of a suitable temperature, and
        wore practically no clothes. This in itself I was told was one
        main cause of their health and contentment. They rolled and
        tumbled on smooth mattresses; pulled themselves up and swung
        back and forth on large, soft horizontal ropes fastened within
        reach; delightful little bunches of rose leaves and dimples, in
        perfect happiness.</p>
        <p>Very early they had water to play in; clean, shallow pools,
        kept at a proper temperature, where they splashed and gurgled in
        rapture, and learned to swim before they learned to walk,
        sometimes.</p>
        <p>As they grew larger and more competent, their playgrounds
        were more extensive and varied; but the underlying idea was
        always clear—safety and pleasure, full exercise and development
        of every power. There was no quarrelling over toys—whatever they
        had to play with they all had in abundance; and most of the time
        they did not have exchangeable objects, but these ropes, pools,
        sand, clay, and so on, materials common to all; and the main joy
        was in the use of their own little bodies, is as many ways as
        was possible.</p>
        <p>At any time when they were not asleep a procession of crowing
        toddlers could be seen creeping up a slight incline and sliding
        or rolling triumphantly down the other side. A sort of
        beautified cellar door, this.</p>
        <p>Strange that we always punished children for sliding down
        unsuitable things and never provided suitable ones. But then, of
        course, one could not have machinery like this in one brief
        family. Swings, see-saws, all manner of moving things they had,
        with building-blocks, of course, and balls. But as soon as it
        was easy to them they had tools and learned to use them; the
        major joy of their expanding lives was doing things. I speak of
        them in an unbroken line, for that was the way they lived. Each
        stage lapped over into the next, and that natural ambition to be
        with the older ones and do what they did was the main incentive
        in their progress.</p>
        <p>To go on, to get farther, higher, to do something better and
        more interesting, this was in the atmosphere; growth, exercise,
        and joy.</p>
        <p>I watched and studied, and grew happy as I did so; which I
        could see was a gratification to Nellie.</p>
        <p>“Aren’t they ever naughty?” I demanded one day.</p>
        <p>“Why should they be?” she answered. “How could they be? What
        we used to call ‘naughtiness’ was only the misfit. The poor
        little things were in the wrong place—and nobody knew how to
        make them happy. Here there is nothing they can hurt, and
        nothing that can hurt them. They have earth, air, fire, and
        water to play with.”</p>
        <p>“Fire?” I interrupted.</p>
        <p>“Yes, indeed. All children love fire, of course. As soon as
        they can move about they are taught fire.”</p>
        <p>“How many burn themselves up?”</p>
        <p>“None. Never any more. Did you never hear ‘a burnt child
        dreads the fire’? We said that, but we never had sense enough to
        use it. No proverb ever said ‘a whipped child dreads the fire’!
        We never safe-guarded them, and the poor little things were
        always getting burned to death in our barbarous ‘homes’!”</p>
        <p>“Do you arbitrarily burn them all?” I asked. “Have an annual
        ‘branding’?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no; but we allow them to burn themselves—within reason.
        Come and see.”</p>
        <p>She showed me a set of youngsters learning Heat and Cold,
        with basins of water, a row of them; eagerly experimenting with
        cautious little fingers—very cold, cold, cool, tepid, warm, hot,
        very hot. They could hardly say the words plain, but learned
        them all, even when they all had to shut their eyes and the
        basins were changed about.</p>
        <p>Straying from house to house, from garden to garden, I
        watched them grow and learn. On the long walls about them were
        painted an endless panorama of human progress. When they noticed
        and asked questions they were told, without emphasis, that
        people used to live that way; and grew to this—and this.</p>
        <p>I found that as the children grew older they all had a year
        of travel; each human being knew his world. And when I
        questioned as to expense, as I always did, Nellie would flatten
        me with things like this:</p>
        <p>“Remember that we used to spend 70 per cent, of our national
        income on the expenses of war, past and present. If we women had
        done no more than save that, it would have paid for all you
        see.”</p>
        <p>Or she would remind me again of the immense sums we used to
        spend on hospitals and prisons; or refer to the general change
        in economics, that inevitable socialization of industry, which
        had checked waste and increased productivity so much.</p>
        <p>“We are a rich people, John,” she repeated. “So are other
        nations, for that matter; the world’s richer. We have increased
        our output and lowered our expenses at the same time. One of our
        big present problems is what to do with our big surplus; we
        quarrel roundly over that. But meanwhile it is a very poor
        nation indeed that does not provide full education for its
        children.”</p>
        <p>I found that the differences in education were both subtle
        and profound. The babies’ experience of group life, as well as
        the daily return to family life, gave a sure ground-work for the
        understanding of civics. Their first impressions included other
        babies; no child grew up with the intensified self-consciousness
        we used to almost force upon them.</p>
        <p>In all the early years learning was ceaseless and
        unconscious. They grew among such carefully chosen surroundings
        as made it impossible not to learn what was really necessary;
        and to learn it as squirrels learn the trees—by playing and
        working in them. They learned the simple beginnings of the
        world’s great trades, led by natural interest and desire,
        gathering by imitation and asked instruction.</p>
        <p>I saw nowhere the enforced task; everywhere the eager
        attention of real interest.</p>
        <p>“Are they never taught to apply themselves? To concentrate?”
        I asked. And for answer she showed me the absorbed, breathless
        concentration of fresh young minds and busy hands.</p>
        <p>“But they soon tire of these things and want to do something
        else, do they not?”</p>
        <p>“Of course. That is natural to childhood. And there is always
        something else for them to do.”</p>
        <p>“But they are only doing what they like to do—that is no
        preparation for a life work surely.”</p>
        <p>“We find it an excellent preparation for life work. You see,
        we all work at what we like now. That is one reason we do so
        much better work.”</p>
        <p>I had talked on this line before with those who explained the
        workings of industrial socialism.</p>
        <p>“Still, as a matter of education,” I urged, “is it not
        necessary for a child to learn to compel himself to work?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no,” they told me; and, to say truth, convincingly
        showed me. “Children like to work. If any one does not, we know
        he is sick.”</p>
        <p>And as I saw more and more of the child-gardens, and sat
        silently watching for well-spent hours, I found how true this
        was.</p>
        <p>The children had around them the carefully planned stimuli of
        a genuinely educational environment. The work of the world was
        there, in words of one syllable, as it were; and among wise,
        courteous, pleasant people, themselves actually doing something,
        yet always ready to give information when asked.</p>
        <p>First the natural appetite of the young brain, then every
        imaginable convenience for learning, then the cautiously used
        accessories to encourage further effort; and then these
        marvelous teachers—who seemed to like their work, too. The
        majority were women, and of them nearly all were mothers. It
        appeared that children had not lost their mothers, as at first
        one assumed, but that each child kept his own and gained others.
        And these teaching mothers were somehow more motherly than the
        average.</p>
        <p>Nellie was so pleased when I noticed this. She liked to see
        me “going to school” so regularly. I was not alone in it,
        either. There seemed to be numbers of people who cared enough
        for children to enjoy watching them and playing with them.
        Nobody was worn out with child care. The parents were not—the
        nurses and teachers had short shifts—it seemed to be considered
        a pleasure and an honor to be allowed with the little ones.</p>
        <p>And in all this widespread, costly, elaborate, and yet
        perfectly simple and lovely environment, these little New
        Persons grew and blossomed with that divine unconsciousness
        which belongs to children.</p>
        <p>They did not know that the best intellects were devoted to
        their service, they never dreamed what thought and love and
        labor made these wide gardens, these bright playing-places,
        these endlessly interesting shops where they could learn to make
        things as soon as they were old enough. They took it all as
        life—just Life, as a child must take his first environment.</p>
        <p>“And don’t you think, John,” Nellie said, when I spoke of
        this, “don’t you really think this is a more normal environment
        for a young human soul than a kitchen? Or a parlor? Or even a
        nursery?”</p>
        <p>I had to admit that it had its advantages. As they grew older
        there was every chance for specialization. In the first years
        they gathered the rudiments of general knowledge, and of general
        activity, of both hand and brain, and from infancy each child
        was studied, and his growth—or hers—carefully recorded; not by
        adoring, intimately related love, but by that larger, wiser
        tenderness of these great child-lovers who had had hundreds of
        them to study.</p>
        <p>They were observed intelligently. Notes were made, the mother
        and father contributed theirs; in freedom and unconsciousness
        the young nature developed, never realizing how its environment
        was altered to fit its special needs.</p>
        <p>As the cool, spacious, flower-starred, fruitful forests of
        this time differed from the tangled underbrush, with crooked,
        crowded, imperfect trees struggling for growth, that I
        remembered as “woods,” or from clipped and twisted products of
        the forcing and pruning process; so did the new child-gardens
        differ from the old schools.</p>
        <p>No wonder children wore so different an aspect. They had the
        fresh, insatiable thirst for knowledge which has been wisely
        slaked, but never given the water-torture. As I recalled my own
        youth, and thought of all those young minds set in rows, fixed
        open as with a stick between the teeth, and forced to drink,
        drink, drink till all desire was turned to loathing, I felt a
        sudden wish to be born again—now!—and begin over.</p>
        <p>As an adult observer, I found this re-arranged world jarring
        and displeasing in many ways; but as I sat among the children,
        played with them, talked with them, became somewhat acquainted
        with their views of things, I began to see that to them the new
        world was both natural and pleasant.</p>
        <p>When they learned that I was a “left-over” from what to them
        seemed past ages, I became extremely popular. There was a rush
        to get near me, and eager requests to tell them about old
        times—checked somewhat by politeness, yet always eager.</p>
        <p>But the cheerful pride with which I began to describe the
        world as I knew it was considerably dashed by their comments.
        What I had considered as necessary evils, or as no evils at all,
        to them appeared as silly and disgraceful as cannibalism; and
        there grew among them an attitude of chivalrous pity for my
        unfortunate upbringing which was pretty to see.</p>
        <p>“I see no child in glasses!” I suddenly remarked one day.</p>
        <p>“Of course not,” answered the teacher I stood by. “We use
        books very little, you see. Education no longer impairs our
        machinery.”</p>
        <p>I recalled the Boston school children and the myopic victims
        of Germany’s archaic letter-press; and freely admitted that this
        was advance. Much of the instruction was oral—much, very much,
        came through games and exercises; books, I found, were regarded
        rather as things to consult, like a dictionary, or as
        instruments of high enjoyment.</p>
        <p>“School books”—“text books”—scarcely existed, at least for
        children. The older ones, some of them, plunged into study with
        passion; but their eyes were good and their brains were strong;
        also their general health. There was no “breakdown from
        over-study;” that slow, cruel, crippling injury—sometimes death,
        which we, wise and loving parents of past days, so frequently
        forced upon our helpless children.</p>
        <p>Naturally happy, busy, self-respecting, these grew up; with a
        wide capacity for action, a breadth of general knowledge which
        was almost incredible, a high standard of courtesy, and
        vigorous, well-exercised minds. They were trained to think, I
        found; to question, discuss, decide; they could reason.</p>
        <p>And they faced life with such loving enthusiasm! Such pride
        in the new accomplishments of the world! Such a noble, boundless
        ambition to do things, to make things, to help the world still
        further.</p>
        <p>And from infancy to adolescence—all through these years of
        happy growing—there was nothing whatever to differentiate the
        boys from the girls! As a rule, they could not be
        distinguished.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
        <p>IT was this new growth of humanity which made continuing
        social progress so rapid and so sure.</p>
        <p>These young minds had no rubbish in them. They had a vivid
        sense of the world as a whole, quite beyond their family
        “relations.” They were marvelously reasonable, free from
        prejudice, able to see and willing to do. And this spreading
        tide of hope and courage flowed back into the older minds, as
        well as forward into the new</p>
        <p>I found that peopled ideas of youth and age had altered
        materially. Nellie said it was due to the change in women—but
        then she laid most things to that. She reminded me that women
        used to be considered only as females, and were “old” when no
        longer available in that capacity; but that as soon as they
        recognized themselves as human beings they put “Grandma” into
        the background, and “Mother” too; and simply went on working and
        growing and enjoying life up into the lively eighties—even
        nineties, sometimes.</p>
        <p>“Brains do not cease to function at fifty,” she said. “Just
        because a woman is no longer an object to ‘fall in love’ with,
        it does not follow that life has no charms for her. Women today
        have all that they ever had before, all that was good in it; and
        more, a thousand times more. When the lives of half the world
        widen like that it widens the other half too.”</p>
        <p>This quite evidently had happened.</p>
        <p>The average mental standard was higher, the outlook broader.
        I found many very ordinary people, of course; some whose only
        attitude toward this wonderful new world was to enjoy its
        advantages; and even some who grumbled. These were either old
        persons with bad digestions or new immigrants from very backward
        countries.</p>
        <p>I traveled about, visiting different places, consulting all
        manner of authorities, making notes, registering objections. It
        was all interesting, and grew more so as it seemed less strange.
        My sense of theatrical unreality gave way to a growing
        appreciation of the universal beauty about me.</p>
        <p>Art, I found, held a very different position from what it
        used to hold. It had joined hands with life again, was common,
        familiar, used in all things. There were pictures, many and
        beautiful, but the great word Art was no longer so closely
        confined to its pictorial form. It was not narrow, expensive,
        requiring a special education, but part of the atmosphere in
        which all children grew, all people lived.</p>
        <p>For instance the theatre, which I remember as a two-dollar
        affair, and mainly vulgar and narrow, was now the daily
        companion and teacher. The historic instinct with which nearly
        every child is born was cultivated without check. The little
        ones played through all their first years of instruction, played
        the old stone age (most natural to them!) the new stone age, the
        first stages of industry. Older children learned history that
        way; and as they reached years of appreciation, special dramas
        were written for them, in which psychology and sociology were
        learned without hearing their names.</p>
        <p>Those happy, busy, eager young things played gaily through
        wide ranges of human experience; and when these emotions touched
        them in later years, they were not strange and awful, but easy
        to understand.</p>
        <p>In every smallest village there was a playhouse, not only in
        the child-gardens, but for the older people. They each had their
        dramatic company, as some used to have their bands; had their
        musical companies too, and better ones.</p>
        <p>Out of this universal use of the drama rose freely those of
        special talent who made it the major business of their lives;
        and the higher average everywhere gave to these greater ones the
        atmosphere of real appreciation which a growing art must
        have.</p>
        <p>I asked Nellie how the people managed who lived in the real
        country—remote and alone.</p>
        <p>“We don’t live that way any more,” she said. “Only some
        stubborn old people, like Uncle Jake and Aunt Dorcas. You see
        the women decided that they must live in groups to have proper
        industrial and educational advantages; and they do.”</p>
        <p>“Where do the men live?” I asked grimly.</p>
        <p>“With the women, of course—Where should they? I don’t mean
        that a person cannot go and live in a hut on a mountain, if he
        likes; we do that in summer, very largely. It is a rest to be
        alone part of the time. But living, real human living, requires
        a larger group than one family. You can see the results.”</p>
        <p>I could and I did; though I would not always admit it to
        Nellie; and this beautiful commonness of good music, good
        architecture, good sculpture, good painting, good drama, good
        dancing, good literature, impressed me increasingly. Instead of
        those perpendicular peaks of isolated genius we used to have,
        surrounded by the ignorantly indifferent many, and the
        excessively admiring few, those geniuses now sloped gently down
        to the average on long graduated lines of decreasing ability. It
        gave to the commonest people a possible road of upward
        development, and to the most developed a path of connection with
        the commonest people. The geniuses seemed to like it too. They
        were not so conceited, not so disagreeable, not so lonesome.</p>
        <p>People seemed to have a very good time, even while at work;
        indeed very many found their work more fun than anything else. .
        The abundant leisure gave a sort of margin to life which was
        wholly new, to the majority at least. It was that spare time,
        and the direct efforts of the government in wholesale
        educational lines, which had accomplished so much in the first
        ten years.</p>
        <p>Owen reminded me of the educational vitality even of the
        years I knew; of the university extension movement, the lectures
        in the public schools, the push of the popular magazines; the
        summer schools, the hundreds of thousands of club women, whose
        main effort seemed to be to improve their minds.</p>
        <p>“And the Press,” I said—“our splendid Press.”</p>
        <p>“That was one of our worst obstacles, I’m sorry to say,” he
        answered.</p>
        <p>I looked at him. “Oh, go ahead, go ahead! You’ll tell me the
        public schools were an obstacle next.”</p>
        <p>“They would have been—if we hadn’t changed them,” he agreed.
        “But they were in our hands at least, and we got them
        re-arranged very promptly. That absurd old despotism which kept
        the grade of teachers down so low, was very promptly changed. We
        have about five times as many teachers now, fifty times as good
        and far better paid, not only in cash, but in public
        appreciation. Our teachers are ‘leading citizens’ now—we have
        elected one President from the School Principalship of a
        state.”</p>
        <p>This was news, and not unpleasant.</p>
        <p>“Have you elected any Editors?”</p>
        <p>“No—but we may soon. They are a new set of men now I can tell
        you; and women, of course. You remember in our day journalism
        was frankly treated as a trade; whereas it is visibly one of the
        most important professions.”</p>
        <p>“And did you so reform those Editors, so that they became as
        self-sacrificing as country doctors?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. But we changed the business conditions. It was the
        advertising that corrupted the papers—mostly; and the
        advertisers were only screaming for bread and butter—especially
        butter. When Socialism reorganized business there was no need to
        scream.</p>
        <p>“But I find plenty of advertising in the papers and
        magazines.”</p>
        <p>“Certainly—it is a great convenience. Have you studied
        it?”</p>
        <p>I had to own that I had not particularly—I never did like
        advertising.</p>
        <p>“You’ll find it worth reading. In the first place it’s all
        true.”</p>
        <p>“How do you secure that?”</p>
        <p>“We have made lying to the public a crime—don’t you remember?
        Each community has its Board of Standards; there is a constant
        effort to improve standards you see, in all products; and expert
        judgment may always be had, for nothing. If any salesman
        advertises falsely he loses his job, if he’s an official; and is
        posted, if he’s selling as a private individual. When the public
        is told officially that Mr. Jones is a liar it hurts his
        trade.”</p>
        <p>“You have a Government Press?”</p>
        <p>“Exactly. The Press is pre-eminently a public function—it is
        not and never was a private business—not legitimately.”</p>
        <p>“But you do have private papers and magazines?”</p>
        <p>“Yes indeed, lots of them. Ever so many personal ‘organs’
        large and small. But they don’t carry advertising. If enough
        people will buy a man’s paper to pay him, he’s quite free to
        publish.”</p>
        <p>“How do you prevent his carrying advertising?”</p>
        <p>“It’s against the law—like any other misdemeanor. Post Office
        won’t take it—he can’t distribute. No, if you want to find out
        about the latest breakfast food—( and there are a score you
        never heard of)—or the last improvement in fountain pens or
        air-ships—you find it all, clear, short, and reliable, in the
        hotel paper of every town. There’s no such bulk of advertising
        matter now, you see; not so many people struggling to sell the
        same thing.”</p>
        <p>“Is all business socialized?”</p>
        <p>“Yes—and no. All the main business is; the big assured steady
        things that our life depends on. But there is a free margin for
        individual initiative—and always will be. We are not so foolish
        as to cut off that supply. We have more inventors and idealists
        than ever; and plenty of chance for trial. You see the two hours
        a day which pays board, so to speak, leaves plenty of time to do
        other work; and if the new thing the man does is sufficiently
        valuable to enough people, he is free to do that alone. Like the
        little one-man papers I spoke of. If a man can find five
        thousand people who will pay a dollar a year to read what he
        says he’s quite as likely to make his living that way.” “Have
        you no competition at all?” “Plenty of it. All our young folks
        are? racing and chasing to break the record; to do more work,
        better work, new work.”</p>
        <p>“But not under the spur of necessity.”</p>
        <p>“Why, yes they are. The most compelling necessity we know.
        They have to do it; it is in them and must come out.”</p>
        <p>“But they are all sure of a living, aren’t they?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, of course. Oh, I see! What you meant by necessity was
        hunger and cold. Bless you, John, poverty was no spur. It was a
        deadly anaesthetic.”</p>
        <p>I looked my disagreement, and he went on: “You remember the
        hideous poverty and helplessness of the old days—did that ‘spur’
        the population to do anything? Don’t you see, John, that if
        poverty had been the splendid stimulus it used to be thought,
        there wouldn’t have been any poverty? Some few exceptional
        persons triumphed in spite of it, but we shall never know the
        amount of world loss in the many who did not.</p>
        <p>“It was funny,” he continued meditatively, “how we went on
        believing that in some mysterious way poverty ‘strengthened
        character,’ ‘developed initiative,’ ‘stimulated industry,’ and
        did all manner of fine things; and never turned our eyes on the
        millions of people who lived and died in poverty with weakened
        characters, no initiative, a slow, enforced and hated industry.
        My word, John, what fools we were!”</p>
        <p>I was considering this Government Press he described. “How
        did you dispose of the newspapers you had?”</p>
        <p>“Just as we disposed of the saloons; drove them out of
        business by underselling them with better goods. The laws
        against lying helped too.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t see how you can stop people’s lying”</p>
        <p>“We can’t stop their lying in private, except by better
        social standards; but we can stop public lying, and we have. If
        a paper published a false statement anyone could bring a
        complaint; and the district attorney was obliged to prosecute.
        If a paper pleaded ignorance or misinformation it was let off
        with a fine and a reprimand the first time, a heavy fine the
        second time, and confiscation the third time; as being proved by
        their own admission incompetent to tell the truth! If it was
        shown to be an intentional falsehood they were put out of
        business at once.”</p>
        <p>“That’s all very pretty,” I said, “and sounds easy as you
        tell it; but what made people so hot about lying? They didn’t
        used to mind it. The more you tell me of these things the more
        puzzled I am as to what altered the minds of the people. They
        certainly had to alter considerably from the kind I remember, to
        even want all these changes, much more to enforce them.”</p>
        <p>Owen wasn’t much of a psychologist, and said so. He insisted
        that people had wanted better things, only they did not know
        it.</p>
        <p>“Well—what made them know it?” I insisted. “Now here’s one
        thing, small in a way, but showing a very long step in
        alteration; people dress comfortably and beautifully; almost all
        of them. What made them do it?”</p>
        <p>“They have more money,” Owen began, “more leisure and better
        education.”</p>
        <p>But I waved this aside.</p>
        <p>“That has nothing to do with it. The people with money and
        education were precisely the ones who wore the most outrageous
        clothes. And as to leisure—they spent their leisure in getting
        up foolish costumes, apparently.”</p>
        <p>“Women are more intelligent, you see,” he began again; but I
        dismissed this also.</p>
        <p>“The intelligence of a Lord Chancellor didn’t prevent his
        wearing a wig! How did people break loose from the force of
        fashion, I want to know?”</p>
        <p>He could not make this clear, and said he wouldn’t try.</p>
        <p>“You show me all these material changes,” I went on; “and I
        can see that there was no real obstacle to them; but the
        obstacle that lasted so long was in the people’s minds. What
        moved that? Then you show me this marvellous new education, as
        resulting in new kinds of people, better people, wiser, freer,
        stronger, braver; and I can see that at work. But how did you
        come to accept this new education? You needn’t lay it all to the
        women, as Nellie does. I knew one or two of the most advanced of
        them in 1910, and they had no such world-view as this. They wore
        foolish clothes and had no ideas beyond ‘Votes for Women’—some
        of them.”</p>
        <p>“No sir! I admit that there was potential wealth enough in
        the earth to support all this ease and beauty; and potential
        energy in the people to produce the wealth. I admit that it was
        possible for people to leave off being stupid and become
        wise—evidently they have done so. But I don’t see what made
        them.”</p>
        <p>“You go and see Dr. Borderson,” said Owen.</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
        <p>DR. BORDERSON, it seemed, held the chair in Ethics at the
        University, I knew a Borderson once and was very fond of him.
        Poor Frank! If he was alive he would have more likely reached a
        prison or a hospital than a professorship. Yet he was brilliant
        enough. We were great friends in college, and before; let me
        see—thirty-five years ago. But he was expelled for improper
        conduct, and went from bad to worse. The last I had heard of him
        was in a criminal case—but he had run away and disappeared. I
        well remembered the grief and shame it was to me at the time to
        see such a promising young life ruined and lost so early.</p>
        <p>Thinking of this, I was shown into the study of the great
        teacher of ethics, and as I shook hands I met the keen brown
        eyes of—Frank Borderson. He had both my hands and shook them
        warmly.</p>
        <p>“Well, John! It is good to see you again. How well you look;
        how little you have changed! It’s a good world you’ve come back
        to, isn’t it?”</p>
        <p>“You are the most astonishing thing I’ve seen so far,” I
        replied. “Do you really mean it? Are you—a Professor of
        Ethics?”</p>
        <p>“When I used to be a God-forsaken rascal, eh? Yes, it’s
        really so. I‘ve taught Ethics for twenty years, and gradually
        pushed along to this position. And I was a good deal farther off
        than Tibet, old man.”</p>
        <p>I was tremendously glad to see him. It was more like a touch
        of the old life than anything I had yet found—except Nellie, of
        course. We spoke for some time of those years of boyhood; of the
        good times we had had together; of our common friends.</p>
        <p>He kept me to dinner; introduced me to his wife, a woman with
        a rather sad, sweet face, which seemed to bear marks of deep
        experience; and we settled down for an evening’s talk.</p>
        <p>“I think you have come to the right person, John; not only
        because of my special studies, but because of my special line of
        growth. If I can tell you what changed me, so quickly and so
        wholly, you won’t be much puzzled about the others, eh?”</p>
        <p>I fully agreed with him. The boy I knew was clever enough to
        dismiss all theology, to juggle with philosophy and pick ethics
        to pieces; but his best friends had been reluctantly compelled
        to admit that he had “no moral character.” He had, to my
        knowledge, committed a number of unquestionable “sins,” and by
        hearsay I knew of vices and crimes that followed. And he was
        Dr. Borderson!</p>
        <p>“Ill take myself as a sample, Whitman fashion,” said he.
        “There I was when you knew me—conceited, ignorant, clever,
        self-indulgent, weak, sensual, dishonest. After I was turned out
        of college I broke a good many laws and nearly all the
        commandments. What was worse, in one way, was that my ‘wages’
        were being paid me in disease—abominable disease. Also I had two
        drug habits—alcohol and cocaine. Will you take me as a
        sample?”</p>
        <p>I looked at him. He had not the perfect health I saw so much
        of in the younger people; but he seemed in no way an invalid,
        much less a drug victim. His eyes were clear and bright, his
        complexion good, his hand steady, his manner assured and
        calm.</p>
        <p>“Frank,” said I, “you beat anything I’ve seen yet. You stand
        absolutely to my mind as an illustration of ‘Before Taking’ and
        ‘After Taking.’ Now in the name of reason tell me what it was
        you Took!”</p>
        <p>“I took a new grip on Life—that’s the whole answer. But you
        want to know the steps, and I’ll tell you. The new stage of
        ethical perception we are in now—or, as you would probably say,
        this new religion—presents itself to me in this way:</p>
        <p>“The business of the universe about us consists in the
        Transmission of Energy. Some of it is temporarily and partially
        arrested in material compositions; some is more actively
        expressed in vegetable and animal form; this stage of expression
        we call Life. We ourselves, the human animals, were specially
        adapted for high efficiency in storing and transmitting this
        energy; and so were able to enter into a combination still more
        efficient; that is, into social relations. Humanity, man in
        social relation, is the best expression of the Energy that we
        know. This Energy is what the human mind has been conscious of
        ever since it was conscious at all; and calls God. The relation
        between this God and this Humanity is in reality a very simple
        one. In common with all other life forms, the human being must
        express itself in normal functioning. Because of its special
        faculty of consciousness, this human engine can feel, see,
        think, about the power within it; and can use it more fully and
        wisely. All it has to learn is the right expression of its
        degree of life-force, of Social Energy.” He beamed at me. “I
        think it’s about all there, John.”</p>
        <p>“You may be a very good Professor of Ethics for these
        new-made minds, but you don’t reach the old kind—not a little
        bit. To my mind you haven’t said anything—yet.”</p>
        <p>He seemed a little disappointed, but took it mildly. “Perhaps
        I am a little out of touch. Wait a moment—let me go back and try
        to take up the old attitude.”</p>
        <p>He leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes, I saw an
        expression of pain slowly grow and deepen on his face; and
        suddenly realized what he was doing.</p>
        <p>“Oh, never mind, Frank; don’t do it; don’t try, I’ll catch on
        somehow.”</p>
        <p>He seemed not to hear me; but dropped his face in his hands.
        When he raised it it was clear again. “Now I can make things
        clearer perhaps,” he said. “We had in our minds thirty years ago
        a strange hodge-podge of old and new ideas. What was called God
        was still largely patterned after the old tribal deity of the
        Hebrews. Our ideas of ‘Sin’ were still mostly of the nature of
        disobedience—wrong only because we were told not to do it. Sin
        as a personal offence against Somebody, and Somebody very much
        offended; that was it. We were beginning to see something of
        Social values, too, but not clearly. Our progress was in what we
        called ‘The natural sciences’; and we did not think with the
        part of our minds wherein we stored religion. Yet there was very
        great activity and progress in religious thought; the whole
        field was in motion; the new churches widening and growing in
        every direction; the older ones holding on like grim death,
        trying not to change, and changing in spite of themselves; and
        Ethics being taught indeed, but with no satisfying basis. That’s
        the kind of atmosphere you and I grew up in, John. Now here was
        I, an ill-assorted team of impulses and characteristics,
        prejudiced against religion, ignorant of real ethics, and
        generally going to the devil—as we used to call it I You know
        how far down I went—or something of it.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t speak of it, Frank!” I said. “That was long ago;
        forget it, old man!” But he turned toward me a smile of
        triumph.</p>
        <p>“Forget it! I wouldn’t forget one step of it if I could! Why,
        John, it’s because of my intimate knowledge of these down-going
        steps that I can help other people up them!”</p>
        <p>“You looked decidedly miserable just now, all the same, when
        you were thinking them over.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, bless you, John, I wasn’t thinking of myself at all! I
        was thinking of the awful state of mind the world was in, and
        how it suffered! Of all the horror and misery and shame; all
        that misplaced, unnecessary cruelty we called punishment; the
        Dark Ages we were still in, in spite of all we had to boast of.
        However, this new perception came.”</p>
        <p>I interrupted him.</p>
        <p>“What came? Who came? Did you have a new revelation? Who did
        it? What do you call it? Nobody seems to be able to give me
        definite information.”</p>
        <p>He smiled broadly. “You’re a beautiful proof of the kind of
        mental jumble I spoke of. Knowledge of evolution did not come by
        a revelation, did it? Or did any one man, or two, give it to us?
        Darwin and Wallace were not the only minds that helped to see
        and express that great idea; and many more had to spread it.
        These great truths break into the world-mind through various
        individuals, and coalesce so that we cannot dis connect them. We
        have had many writers, preachers, lecturers, who discoursed and
        explained; this new precept as to the relation between man and
        God came with such a general sweep that no one even tries to
        give personal credit for it. These things are not personal—they
        are world-percepts.”</p>
        <p>“But every religion has had its Founder, hasn’t it?”</p>
        <p>“<em>I</em> don’t call it a religion, my dear fellow! It’s a
        science, like any other science. Ethics is The Science of Human
        Relation. It is called Applied Sociology—that’s all.”</p>
        <p>“How does a thing like that touch one, personally?” I
        asked.</p>
        <p>“How does any science touch one personally? One studies a
        science, one teaches a science, one uses a science. That’s the
        point—the use of it. Our old scheme of religion was a thing to
        ‘believe,’ or ‘deny’; it was a sort of shibboleth, a test
        question one had to pass examination in to get good marks! What
        I’m telling you about is a general recognition of right
        behavior, and a general grasp of the necessary power.”</p>
        <p>“You leave out entirely the emotional side of religion.”</p>
        <p>“Do I? I did not intend to. You see, we do not distinguish
        religion from life now, and are apt to forget old terms. You are
        thinking, I suppose, of the love of God, and man, which we used
        to preach. We practice it now.</p>
        <p>“That Energy I spoke of, when perceived by us, is called
        Love. Love, the real thing we had in mind when we said ‘God is
        Love,’ is beneficent energy. It is the impulse of service, the
        desire to do, to help, to make, to benefit. That is the ‘love’
        we were told to bestow on one another. Now we do.”</p>
        <p>“Yes; but what made you do it? What keeps you up to it?”</p>
        <p>“Just nature, John. It is human nature. We used to believe
        otherwise.” He was quiet for a while.</p>
        <p>“One of these new doctors got hold of me, when I was about as
        near the bottom as one can go and get back. Not a priest with a
        formula, nor a reformer with an exhortation; but a real
        physician, a soul-doctor, with a passionate enthusiasm for an
        interesting case. That’s what I was, John; not a lost soul; not
        even a ‘sinner’—just ‘a case.’ Have you heard about these moral
        sanitariums?”</p>
        <p>“Yes—but not definitely.”</p>
        <p>“Well, as soon as this view of things took hold, they began
        to want to isolate bad cases, and cure them if they could. And
        they cured me.”</p>
        <p>“How, Frank—how? What did they tell you that you didn’t know
        before? What did they do to you?”</p>
        <p>“Sane, strong, intelligent minds put themselves in connection
        with mine, John, and shared their strength with me. I was
        matters to feel that my individual failure was no great matter,
        but that my social duty wast that the whole of my dirty past was
        as nothing to all our splendid future, that whatever I had done
        was merely to be forgotten—the sooner the better, and that all
        life was open before me—all human life; endless, beautiful,
        profoundly interesting—the game was on, and I was in it.</p>
        <p>“John—I wish I could make you feel it. It was as if we had
        all along had inside us an enormous reservoir of love, human
        love, that had somehow been held in and soured! This new
        arrangement of our minds let it out—to our limitless relief and
        joy. No ‘sin’—think of that I Just let it sink in. No such thing
        as sin. . . . We had, collectively and privately, made mistakes,
        and done the wrong thing, often. What of it? Of course we had. A
        growing race grew that way.</p>
        <p>“Now we are wiser and need not keep on going wrong. We had
        learned that life was far easier, pleasanter, more richly
        satisfying when followed on these new lines—and the new lines
        were not hard to learn. Love was the natural element of social
        life. Love meant service, service meant doing one’s special work
        well, and doing it for the persons served—of course!</p>
        <p>“All our mistakes lay in our belated Individualism. You
        cannot predicate Ethics of individuals; you cannot fulfill any
        religion as individuals. My fellow creatures took hold of me,
        you see. That power that was being used so extensively for
        physical healing in our young days had become a matter of common
        knowledge—and use.”</p>
        <p>“How many of these—moral hygienists—did you have?”</p>
        <p>“Scores, hundreds, thousands—we all help one another now. If
        a person is tired and blue and has lost his grip, if he can’t
        rectify it by change of diet and change of scene, he goes to a
        moral hygienist, as you rightly call it, and gets help. I do a
        lot of that sort of work.”</p>
        <p>I meditated awhile, and again shook my head. “I’m afraid it’s
        no use. I can’t make it seem credible. I hear what you say and I
        see what you’ve done—but I do not get any clear understanding of
        the process. With people as they were, with all those
        case-hardened old sinners, all the crass ignorance, the
        stupidity, the sodden prejudice, the apathy, the selfishness—to
        make a world like that see reason—in thirty years!—No—I don’t
        get it.”</p>
        <p>“You are wrong in your premises, John. Human nature is, and
        was, just as good as the rest of nature. Two things kept us
        back—wrong conditions, and wrong ideas; we y; have changed both.
        I think you forget the ’ sweeping advance in material conditions
        and its effect on character. What made the well-bred,
        well-educated, well-meaning, pleasant people we used to know?
        Good conditions, for them and their ancestors. There were just
        as pleasant people among the poor and among their millions of
        children; they had every capacity for noble growth—given the
        chance. It took no wholesale change of heart to make people want
        shorter hours, better pay, better housing, food, clothes,
        amusements. As soon as the shameful pressure of poverty was
        taken off humanity it rose like a freed spring. Humanity’s all
        right.” I “There were some things all wrong,” I replied, “that I
        know. You could not obliterate hereditary disease in ten—or
        thirty years. You couldn’t make clean women of hundreds of
        thousands of prostitutes. You couldn’t turn an invalid tramp
        into a healthy gentleman.”</p>
        <p>He stopped me. “We could do better than that,” he said, “and
        we have. I begin to see your central difficulty, John; the
        difficulty that used to hold us all. You are looking at life as
        a personal affair—a matter of personal despair or
        salvation.”</p>
        <p>“Of course, what else is it?”</p>
        <p>“What else! Why, that is no part of human life! Human life is
        social, John, collectively, common, or it isn’t human life at
        all. Hereditary disease looks pretty hopeless when you see one
        generation or two or three so cursed. But when you realize how
        swiftly the stream of human life can be cleansed of it, you take
        a fresh hold. The percentage of hereditary disease has sunk by
        more than half in thirty years, John, and at its present rate of
        decrease will be gone, clean gone, in another twenty. Remember
        that every case is known, and that they are either prevented
        from transmitting the inheritance, isolated, or voluntarily
        living single. Diseases from bad conditions we no longer endure,
        nor diseases from ignorance, those from bacilli we are able to
        resist or cure; disease was never a permanent thing—only an
        accident. As for the prostitutes—we thought them ‘ruined’
        because they were no longer suitable for our demands in
        marriage. As if that was everything! I tell you we opened a way
        out for them!”</p>
        <p>“Namely?”</p>
        <p>“Namely all the rest of life! Sex-life isn’t everything,
        John. Not fit to be a mother, we said to them; never mind—there
        is everything else in the world to be. You may remember, my
        friend, that thousands of men, as vicious as any prostitutes,
        and often as diseased, continued to live, to work, and to enjoy.
        Why shouldn’t the women? You haven’t ruined your lives, we said
        to them; only one part. It’s a loss, a great loss, but never
        mind, the whole range of human life remains open to you, the
        great moving world of service and growth and happiness. If
        you’re sick, you’re sick—we’ll cure it if possible. If not,
        you’ll die—never mind, we all die—that’s nothing.”</p>
        <p>“Does your new religion call death nothing?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly. The fuss we made about death was wholly owing to
        the old religions; the post-mortem religions, their whole basis
        was death.”</p>
        <p>“Hold on a bit. Do you mean to tell me the people aren’t
        afraid of death any more?”</p>
        <p>“Not a bit. Why should they be? Every living thing dies;
        that’s part of the living. We do not hide it from children now,
        we teach it to them.”</p>
        <p>“Teach death—to children! How horrible!”</p>
        <p>“Did you see or hear anything horrible in your educational
        excursions, John? I know you didn’t. No, they learn it
        naturally; in their gardens; in their autumn and winter songs;
        in their familiarity with insects and animals. Our children
        learn life, death, and immortality, from silk-worms; and, then
        only incidentally. The silk is what they are studying.</p>
        <p>“It takes a great many silk-worms to make silk, generations
        of them. They see them horn, live and die, as incidents in silk
        culture. So we show them how people are horn, live and die, in
        the making of human history. The idea is worked into our new
        educational literature—and all our literature for that matter.
        We see human life as a continuous whole now. People are only
        temporary parts of it. Dying isn’t any more trouble than being
        born.</p>
        <p>“People feared death, originally, because it hurt; being
        chased and eaten was not pleasant. But natural dying does not
        hurt. Then they were made to fear it by the hell-school of
        religions. All that is gone by. Our religion rests on life.”</p>
        <p>“The life of this world or the life eternal?”</p>
        <p>“The eternal life of this world, John. We have no quarrel
        with anyone’s belief as to what may happen after death, that is
        a free field; but the glory and power of our religion is that it
        rests with assurance on common knowledge of the beautiful facts
        of life. Here is Humanity, a continuing stream of life. Its line
        of advance is clear. That which makes Humanity stronger, wiser
        and happier is evidently what is right for it to do. We do teach
        it to all our children.”</p>
        <p>“And they do it?”</p>
        <p>“Of course they do it. Why shouldn’t they?”</p>
        <p>“But our evil tendencies”</p>
        <p>“We don’t have evil tendencies, John—and never did. We have
        earlier and later tendencies; and it is perfectly possible to
        show the child which is which.”</p>
        <p>“But surely it is easier to follow the lower impulses than
        the higher; easier to give way than to strive.”</p>
        <p>“There’s the old misconception, John, that Striving idea.’ We
        assumed that it was ‘natural’ to be ‘bad’ and ‘unnatural’ to be
        ‘good’—that we had to make special efforts, painful and
        laborious, to become better. We had not seen, thirty years ago,
        that social evolution is as ‘natural’ as the evolution of the
        horse from the eohippus. If it was easier to be an eohippus than
        a horse why did the thing change?</p>
        <p>“As to that army of ‘fallen women 5 you are so anxious about,
        they just got up again, that’s all, got up and went on. They had
        only fallen from one position; there was plenty of room left to
        stand and walk. Why they were not a speck on society compared to
        the ‘fallen men.’ Two hundred thousand prostitutes in the city
        of New York—well? How many patrons? A million, at the least.
        They kept on doing business, and enjoying life. I tell you,
        John, all the unnecessary evils of condition in the old days,
        were as nothing to the unnecessary evils of our foolish ideas!
        And ideas can be changed in the twinkling of an eye!</p>
        <p>“As to your hoboes and bums, that invalid tramp you
        instanced—I can settle your mind on that point. I was an invalid
        tramp, John; a drunkard, a cocaine fiend, a criminal, sick,
        desperate, as bad as they make them.”</p>
        <p>“Which brings us back to that ‘moral sanitarium’ I
        suppose?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. I strayed away from it. I keep forgetting my own case.
        But it is an excellent one for illustration. I was taken hold of
        with the strong hand, and given a course of double treatment,
        deep and thorough. By double treatment I mean physical and
        mental at once; such a complete overhauling and wise care as
        enabled my exhausted vitality slowly to reassert itself, and at
        the same time such strong tender cheerful companionship, such
        well-devised entertainment, such interesting, irresistible
        instruction—Why, John—put a tramp into Paradise, and there’s
        some hope of him.”</p>
        <p>I was about to say that tramps did not deserve Paradise, but
        as I remembered what this man had been, and saw what he was now,
        I refrained.</p>
        <p>He read my mind at once.</p>
        <p>“It’s not a question of desert, John. We no longer deal in
        terms of personal reward or punishment. If I have a bad finger
        or a bad tooth I save it if I can; not because it deserves it,
        but because I need it. People who used to be called sinners are
        now seen to be diseased members of society, and society turns
        all its regenerative forces on at once. We never used to dream
        of that flood of power we had at hand—the Regenerative Forces of
        Society!”</p>
        <p>He sat smiling, his fine eyes full of light. “Sometimes we
        had to amputate,” he continued, “especially at first. It is very
        seldom necessary now.”</p>
        <p>“You mean you killed the worst people?”</p>
        <p>“We killed many hopeless degenerates, insane, idiots, and
        real perverts, after trying our best powers of cure. But it is
        really astonishing to see how much can be done with what we used
        to call criminals, merely by first-class physical treatment. I
        can remember how strange it seemed to me, having elaborate
        baths, massage, electric stimulus, perfect food, clean
        comfortable beds, beautiful clothes, books, music, congenial
        company, and wonderful instruction. It was very confusing. It
        went far to rearrange all my ideas.”</p>
        <p>“If you treat—social invalids—like that, I should think they
        would ‘lie down;’ just to remain in hospital forever. Or go out
        and be bad in order to get back again.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no,” he said. “A healthy man can’t lie around and do
        nothing very long. Also it is good outside too, remember. Life
        is good, pleasant, easy. Why on earth should a man want to prowl
        around at night and steal when he can have all he wants, with
        less effort, in the daytime? Happy people do not become
        criminals.</p>
        <p>“But I can tell you what treatment like that does to one. It
        gives a man a new view of human life, of what it is he belongs
        to. A sense of pride in our common accomplishment, of gratitude
        for the pleasure he receives, of a natural desire to contribute
        something. I took this new ethics—it satisfied me, it’s
        reasonable, it’s necessary. We make it our basic study now, in
        all the schools. You must have noticed that?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I had noticed it, as I looked back. But they don’t call
        it that,” I said.</p>
        <p>“No, they don’t call it anything to the children. It is just
        life, the rules of decent behavior.”</p>
        <p>We sat silent awhile after this. Things were clearing up a
        little in my mind.</p>
        <p>“A sort of crystallization of chaotic progressive thought
        into clear diamonds of usable truth—is that about what
        happened?” I said.</p>
        <p>“That’s exactly it,”</p>
        <p>“And a general refutation and clearing out of—of—”</p>
        <p>“Of a lot of things we deeply believed—that were not so! That
        is what was the matter with us, John. Our minds were full of
        what Mrs. Eddy christened error. I wish I could make you feel
        what a sunrise it was to the world when we left off believing
        lies and learned the facts.”</p>
        <p>“Can you, in a few words, outline a little of your new
        ‘Ethics’ to the lay mind?”</p>
        <p>“Easily. It is all ‘lay’ enough. We don’t make a separate
        profession of religion, or a separate science of ethics. Ethics
        is social hygiene—it teaches how humanity must live in order to
        be well and strong. We show the child the patent facts of social
        relation, how all our daily life, our accumulated wealth and
        beauty and continuing power, rests on common action, on what
        people do together. Everything about him teaches that. Then we
        show him the reasons why such and such actions are wrong, what
        the results are; how to avoid wrong lines of action and adopt
        right ones. It’s no more difficult than teaching any other game,
        and far more interesting.”</p>
        <p>I suppose I looked unconvinced, for he added, “Remember we
        have nature on our side. It is natural for a social animal to
        develop social instincts; any personal desire which works
        against the social good is clearly a survival of a lower
        presocial period; wrong, in that it is out of place. What we
        used to call criminals were relics of the past. By artificially
        maintaining low conditions, such as poverty, individual wealth,
        we bred low-grade types. We do not breed them any more.”</p>
        <p>Again we sat silent. I was nursing my knee and sat looking
        into the fire; the soft shimmering play of rosy light and warmth
        with which electricity now gave jewels to our rooms.</p>
        <p>He followed my eyes.</p>
        <p>“That clean, safe, beautiful power was always here, John—but
        we had not learned of it. The power of wind and water and steam
        were here—before we learned to use them. All this splendid power
        of human life was here—only we did not know it.”</p>
        <p>After that talk with Frank Borderson I felt a little clearer
        in my mind about what had taken place. I saw a good deal of him,
        and he introduced me to others who were in his line of work.
        Also I got to know his wife pretty well. She was not so great an
        authority on ethics as he; but an excellent teacher, widely
        useful.</p>
        <p>One day I said something to her about her lovely spirit, and
        what she must have been to him—such an uplifting influence.</p>
        <p>She laughed outright.</p>
        <p>“Ill have to tell you the facts, Mr. Robertson, as part of
        your instruction. So far from my uplifting him, he picked me out
        of the gutter, literally, dead drunk in the gutter, the lowest
        kind of wreck. He made me over. He gave me—Life.”</p>
        <p>Her eyes shone.</p>
        <p>“We work together,” she added cheerfully.</p>
        <p>They did work together, and evidently knew much happiness. I
        noted a sort of deep close understanding between them, as in
        those who have been through the wars in company,</p>
        <p>I found Nellie knew about them. “Yes, indeed,” she said.
        “They are devoted to each other, and most united in their work.
        He was just beginning to try to work, after his own rebuilding;
        but feeling pretty lonesome. He felt that he had no chance of
        any personal life, you see, and there were times hen he missed
        it badly. He had no right to marry, of course; that is, with a
        well woman. And then he found this broken lily—and mended it.
        There can’t be any children, but there is great happiness, you
        can see that.”</p>
        <p>“And they are—received?”</p>
        <p>“Received?—Oh, I remember. You mean they are invited to
        dinners and parties. Why, yes.”</p>
        <p>“Not among the best people, surely?”</p>
        <p>“Precisely that, the very best; people who appreciate their
        wonderful lives.”</p>
        <p>“Tell me this, Sister; what happened to the Four Hundred—the
        F. F. V’s—and the rest of the aristocracy?”</p>
        <p>“The same thing that happened to all of us. They were only
        people, you see. Their atrophied social consciousness was
        electrified with the new thoughts and feelings. They woke up,
        too, most of them. Some just died out harmlessly. They were only
        by-products.”</p>
        <p>I consulted a rather reactionary old professor of Sociology,
        Morris Banks; one who had been teaching Political Economy in my
        youth, and who ought to be able to remember things. I asked him
        if he would be so good as to show me the dark side of this
        shield.</p>
        <p>“Surely there must have been opposition, misunderstanding,
        the usual difficulties of new adjustments,” I said. “You
        remember the first years of change—I wish you would give me a
        clear account of it.”</p>
        <p>The old man considered awhile: “Take any one state, any city,
        or country locality, and study back a little,” he said, “and you
        find the story is about the same. There was opposition and
        dissent, of course, but it decreased very rapidly. You see the
        improvements at first introduced were such universal benefits
        that there could not be any serious complaint.</p>
        <p>“By the time we had universal suffrage the women were more
        than ready for it, full of working plans to carry out, and rich
        by the experience of the first trials.</p>
        <p>“By the time Socialism was generally adopted we had case
        after case of proven good in Socialistic methods; and also the
        instructive background of some failures.”</p>
        <p>“But the big men who ran the country to suit themselves in my
        time, they didn’t give up without a struggle surely? You must
        have had some fighting,” I said.</p>
        <p>He smiled in cheerful reminiscence. “We had a good deal of
        noise, if that’s what you mean. But there’s no fighting to be
        done, with soldiers, if the soldiers won’t fight.</p>
        <p>Our workingmen declined to shoot or to be shot any longer,
        and left the big capitalists to see what they could do
        alone.”</p>
        <p>“But they had the capital?”</p>
        <p>“Not all of it. The revenues of the cities and of the United
        States Government are pretty considerable, especially when you
        save the seventy per cent, we used to spend on wars past and
        possible; and the ten or twenty-more that went in waste and
        graft. With a Socialist State private Capital has no grip!”</p>
        <p>“Did you confiscate it?”</p>
        <p>“Did not have to. The people who were worth anything, swung
        into line and went to work like other people. Those that weren’t
        were just let alone. Nobody has any respect for them now.”</p>
        <p>“You achieved Socialism without blood-shed?”</p>
        <p>“We did. It did not happen all at once, you see; just spread
        and spread and proved its usefulness.”</p>
        <h1 id="chapter-12.">Chapter 12.</h1>
        <p>MORE and more I cut loose from the explanatory guiding
        strings of my sister and the family, even from the requested
        information of specialists, and wandered by myself in search of
        the widening daily acquaintance which alone could make life seem
        real again.</p>
        <p>It was an easy world to wander in. The standard of general
        courtesy and intelligence of the officials, and of the average
        passer-by, was as much above what I remembered as the standard
        in Boston used to be above that of New York.</p>
        <p>As most of the business was public business one could study
        and inquire freely. As much work as could be advantageously
        localized was so arranged, this saving in transportation. The
        clothing industry, for in stance, instead of being carried on in
        swarming centers, and then distributed all over the country,
        formed part of the pleasant everyday work in each community and
        was mostly in the hands of women.</p>
        <p>As a man I could appreciate little of the improved quality of
        fabrics, save as I noticed their beauty, and that my own clothes
        wore longer, and both looked and felt more agreeable. But women
        told me how satisfying it was to know that silk was silk, and
        wool, wool. This improvement in textile values, with the
        outgrowing of that long obsession called fashion, reduced the
        labor of clothes-making materially.</p>
        <p>Women’s clothes, I found, as I strolled were very delicate
        and fine, and had a gracious dignity and sanity far removed from
        the frantic concoctions I remembered in the windows;—shredded
        patchwork of muslin and lace, necessarily frail and short-lived
        even as ornaments, never useful, and costing arduous labor in
        construction, with corresponding expense to the purchaser.</p>
        <p>The robes and gowns were a joy to the eye. Some showed less
        taste than others, naturally, but nowhere was to be seen the
        shameless ugliness so common in my youth.</p>
        <p>Beauty and peace, I found, care, leisure, quietness, plenty
        of gaiety, too, both in young and old. It struck me that the
        young (people, owing to their wider and sounder upbringing, were
        more serious, and that older people, owing to their safer,
        easier lives, were jollier. These sweet-faced, broad-minded
        young women did not show so much giggling inanity as once seemed
        necessary to them; and a young man, even a young man in college,
        did not, therefore, find pleasure in theft, cruelty, gross
        practical jokes and destruction of property.</p>
        <p>As I noted this, I brought myself up with a start. It looked
        as if Nellie had written it. Surely, when I was in college—and
        there rose up within me a memory of the crass, wasteful follies
        that used to be called “pranks” in my time, and considered
        perfectly natural in young men. I had not minded them in those
        days. It gave me a queer feeling to see by my own words how my
        judgment was affected already.</p>
        <p>I explored the city from end to end, and satisfied myself
        that there was no poverty in it, no street that was not clean,
        no house that was not fit for human habitation. That is, as far
        as I could judge from an outside view.</p>
        <p>Among the masses of people, after their busy mornings, there
        were vast numbers who used the afternoons for learning, the
        easy, interesting, endless learning now carried on far and wide.
        The more they learned the more they wanted to know; and the best
        minds, free for research work, and upheld in it by the deepening
        attention of the world, constantly pushed on the boundaries of
        knowledge.</p>
        <p>There were some hospitals yet, but as one to a hundred of
        what used to be, of higher quality, and fuller usefulness. There
        were some of what I should have called prisons, though the life
        inside was not only as comfortable as that without, but
        administered with a stricter care for the advantage of those
        within.</p>
        <p>There were the moral sanitariums—healthful and beautiful,
        richly endowed with the world’s best methods of improvement, and
        managed by the world’s best people. It made me almost dizzy to
        try to take in this opposite pole of judgment on the
        criminal.</p>
        <p>Out of town I found that the park-like roads, so generally in
        use, by no means interfered with the wide stretches of what I
        used to call “real country.” Intensive agriculture took less
        ground, rather more; and the wide use of food-bearing trees had
        restored the wooded aspect, so pleasant in every sense.</p>
        <p>The small country towns were of special interest to me; I
        visited scores of them; each differing from the others, all
        beautiful and clean and busy. They were numerous too; replacing
        the areas of scattered lonely farmhouses, with these comfortable
        and pretty groups, each in its home park, with its standard of
        convenience as high as that in any town.</p>
        <p>The smallest group had its power plant, supplying all the
        houses with heat, light and water, had its child gardens, its
        Town House and Club House, its workshops and foodshops as
        necessary as its postoffices.</p>
        <p>The Socialized industries ensured employment to every
        citizen, and provided all the necessaries of life—larger order
        this than it used to be. Quite above this broad base of social
        control, the life of the people went on; far freer and more open
        to individual development than it had ever had a chance to be in
        the whole history of the world.</p>
        <p>This I frankly conceded. I found I was making more
        concessions in my note-book than I had yet made to either Nellie
        or Owen. They encouraged me to travel about by myself. In fact,
        my sister was now about to resume her college position and Owen
        was going with her.</p>
        <p>They both advised me not to settle upon any work for a full
        year.</p>
        <p>“That’s little enough time in which to cover thirty,” Nellie
        said, patting my shoulder. “But you’re doing splendidly, John.
        We are proud of you. And there’s no hurry. You know there’s
        enough from our mine to enable you to join the leisure class’—if
        you want to!”</p>
        <p>I had no idea of doing this, as she well knew, but I did feel
        it necessary to get myself in some way grafted on to this new
        world before I took up regular employment. I found that there
        was not much call for ancient languages in the colleges, even if
        I had been in touch with the new methods; but there remained
        plenty of historical work, for which I had now a special
        fitness. Indeed some of my new scientific friends assured me I
        could be of the utmost service, with my unique experience.</p>
        <p>So I was not worried about what to do, nor under any pressure
        about doing it. But the more I saw of all these new advantages,
        the more I was obliged to admit that they were advantages; the
        more I traveled and read and learned, the more lonesome and
        homesick I became.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful world, but it was not my world. It was
        like a beautiful dream, but seemed a dream nevertheless. I could
        no longer dispute that it was possible for people to be
        “healthy, wealthy and wise”; and happy, too—visibly happy—here
        they all were; working and playing and enjoying life as
        naturally as possible. But they were not the people I used to
        know; those, too, were like Frank Borderson and Morris
        Banks—changed so that they seemed more unreal than the
        others.</p>
        <p>The beauty and peace and order of the whole thing wore on—me.
        I wanted to hear the roar of the elevated—to smell the foul air
        of the subway and see the people pile in, pushing and angry, as
        I still remembered in my visits to New York.</p>
        <p>I wanted to see some neglected-looking land, some ragged
        suburbs, some far-away farmhouse alone under its big elms, with
        its own barns in odorous proximity, its own cows, boy-driven,
        running and stumbling home to be milked.</p>
        <p>I wanted a newspaper which gave me the excitement of guessing
        what the truth was, I wanted to see some foolish, crazily
        dressed, giggling girls, and equally foolish boys, but better
        dressed and less giggling, given to cigarettes and uproarious
        “good times.”</p>
        <p>I was homesick, desperately homesick. So without saying a
        word to anyone I betook myself to old Slide-face, to see Uncle
        Jake.</p>
        <p>All the way down—and I went by rail—no air travel for this
        homecoming!—I felt an increasing pleasure in the familiar look
        of things. The outlines of the Alleghanies had not changed. I
        would not get out at any town, the shining neatness of the
        railroad station was enough; but the sleeping cars were a
        disappointment. The beds were wide, soft, cool, the blankets of
        light clean wool, the air clear and fresh, the noise and jar
        almost gone. Oh, well, I couldn’t expect to have everything as
        it used to be, of course.</p>
        <p>But when I struck out, on foot, from Paintertown, and began
        to climb the road that led to my old home, my heart was in my
        mouth. It was a better road, of course—but I hardly noticed
        that. All the outlying farms were better managed and the little
        village groups showed here and there—but I shut my eyes to these
        things.</p>
        <p>The hills were the same—the hills I had grown up among. They
        couldn’t alter the face of the earth much—that was still
        recognizable. Our own house I did not visit—both father and
        mother were gone, and the little wooden building replaced by a
        concrete mining office. Nellie had told me about all this; it
        was one reason why I had not come back before.</p>
        <p>But now I went past our place almost with my eyes shut; and
        kept on along the road to Uncle Jake’s. He had been a rich man,
        as farmers went, owning the land for a mile or two on every
        side, owning Slide-face as a matter of fact; and as he made
        enough from the rich little upland valley where the house stood,
        to pay his taxes, he owned it still.</p>
        <p>The moment I reached his boundary I knew it, unmistakably. A
        ragged, home-made sign, sagging from its nails, announced
        “Private Road. No trespassers allowed.” Evidently they heeded
        the warning, for the stony, washed-out roadbed was little
        traveled.</p>
        <p>My heart quite leaped as I set foot on it. It was not
        “improved” in the least from what I remembered in my infrequent
        visits. My father and Uncle Jake had “a coldness” between them;
        which would have been a quarrel, I fancy, if father had not been
        a minister, so I never saw much of these relations.</p>
        <p>Drusilla I remembered well enough, though, a pretty, babyish
        thing, and Aunt Dorcas’s kind, patient, tired smile, and the
        fruit cakes she made.</p>
        <p>Up and up, through the real woods, ragged and thick with dead
        boughs, fallen trunks and underbrush, not touched by any
        forester, and finally, around the shoulder of Slide-face, to the
        farm.</p>
        <p>I stood still and drew in a long breath of utter
        satisfaction. Here was something that had not changed. There was
        an old negro plowing, the same negro I remembered, apparently
        not a day older. It is wonderful ( how little they do change
        with years. His wool showed white though, as he doffed his
        ragged cap and greeted me with cheerful cordiality as Mass’
        John.</p>
        <p>“We all been hearin’ about you, Mass’ John. We been powerful
        sorry ’bout you long time, among de heathen,” he said. “You
        folks’ll be glad to see you!”</p>
        <p>“Well, young man!” said Uncle Jake, with some show of
        cordiality; “better late than never. We wondered if you intended
        to look up your country relations.”</p>
        <p>But Aunt Dorcas put her thin arms around my neck and kissed
        me, teary kisses with little pats and exclamations. “To think of
        it! Thirty years among savages! We heard about it from
        Nellie—she wrote us, of course. Nellie’s real good to Keep us
        posted.”</p>
        <p>“She never comes to see us!” said my Uncle. “Nor those
        youngsters of hers. We’ve never had them here but once. They’re
        too ‘advanced’ for old-fashioned folks.”</p>
        <p>Uncle Jake’s long upper lip set firmly; I remembered that
        look, as he used to sit in his wagon and talk with mother at our
        gate, refusing to come in, little sunny-haired Drusilla looking
        shyly at me from under her sunbonnet the while.</p>
        <p>Where was Drusilla? Surely not—that! A frail, weak, elderly,
        quiet, little woman stood there by Aunt Dorcas, her smooth fine,
        ash-brown hair drawn tightly back to a flat knot behind, her
        dull blue calico dress falling starkly about her.</p>
        <p>She came forward, smiling, and held out a thin work-worn
        hand. “We’re so glad to see you, Cousin John,” she said. “We
        certainly are.”</p>
        <p>They made much of me in the old familiar ways I had so
        thirsted for. The sense of family background, of common
        knowledge and experience was comforting in the extreme, the very
        furnishings and clothes as I recalled them. I told them what a
        joy it was.</p>
        <p>This seemed to please Uncle Jake enormously.</p>
        <p>“I thought you’d do it,” he said. “Like to find one place
        that hasn’t been turned upside down by all these new-fangled
        notions. Dreadful things have been goin’ on, John, while you
        were amongst them Feejees.”</p>
        <p>I endeavored to explain to him something of the nature and
        appearance of the inhabitants of Tibet, but it made small
        impression. Uncle Jake’s mind was so completely occupied by what
        was in it, that any outside fact or idea had small chance of
        entry.</p>
        <p>“They’ve got wimmin votin’ now, I understand,” he pursued; “I
        don’t read the papers much, they are so ungodly, but I’ve heard
        that. And they’ve been meddlin’ with Divine Providence in more
        ways than one—but I keep out of it, and so does Aunt Dorcas and
        the girl here.”</p>
        <p>He looked around at my Aunt, who smiled her gentle, faithful
        smile, and at Drusilla, who dropped her eyes and flushed
        faintly. I suspected her of secret leanings toward the movement
        of the world outside.</p>
        <p>“I don’t allow my family off the farm,” he went on, “except
        when we go to meetin’, and that’s not often. There’s hardly an
        orthodox preacher left, seems to me; hut we go up to the Ridge
        meetin’ house sometimes.”</p>
        <p>“I should think you would find it a little dull—don’t you?” I
        ventured.</p>
        <p>Drusilla flashed a grateful look at me.</p>
        <p>“Nothing of the sort,” he answered. “I was horn on this farm,
        and it’s big enough for anybody to be contented on. Your Aunt
        was born over in Hadley Holler—and she’s contented enough. As
        for Drusilly—” he looked at her again with real affection,
        “Drusilly’s always been a good girl—never made any trouble in
        her life. Unless ’twas when she pretty near married that heretic
        minister—eh, Drusilly?”</p>
        <p>My cousin did not respond warmly to this sally, but neither
        did she show signs of grief. I was conscious of a faint
        satisfaction that she had not married the heretic minister.</p>
        <p>They made me very welcome, so welcome indeed that as days
        passed, Uncle Jake even broached the subject of my remaining
        there.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got no son,” he said, “and a girl can’t run the farm.
        You stay here, John, and keep things goin’, and I’ll will it to
        you—what do you say? You ain’t married, I see. Just get you a
        nice girl—if there’s any left, and settle down here.”</p>
        <p>I thanked him warmly, but said I must have time to
        consider—that I had thought of accepting other work which
        offered.</p>
        <p>He was most insistent about it. “You better stay here, John.
        Here’s pure air and pure food—none of these artificial kickshaws
        I hear of folks havin’ nowadays. We smoke our own hams just as
        we used to do in my grandfather’s time—there’s none better. We
        buy sugar and rice and coffee and such as that; but I grind my
        own corn in the little mill there on the creek—reckon I’m the
        only one who uses it now. And your Aunt runs her loom to this
        day. Drusilly can, too, but she ’lows she hates to do it. Girls
        aren’t what they used to be when I was young!”</p>
        <p>It did not seem possible that Uncle Jake had ever been young.
        His sturdy, stooping frame, his hard, ruddy features were the
        same at seventy as I remembered them at forty, only the hair,
        whitened and thinned, was different.</p>
        <p>My bedroom was exactly as when I last slept in it, on my one
        visit to the farm as a boy of fifteen. Drusilla had seemed only
        a baby then—a slender little five-year old. She had followed me
        about in silence, with adoring eyes, and I had teased her!—I
        hated to think of how I had teased her.</p>
        <p>The gold in her hair was all dulled and faded, the rose-leaf
        color of her cheeks had faded, too, and her blue eyes wore a
        look of weary patience. She worked hard. Her mother was
        evidently feeble now, and the labor required in that primitive
        home was considerable.</p>
        <p>The old negro brought water from the spring and milked the
        cows, but all the care of the dairy, the cooking for the family,
        the knitting and sewing and mending and the sweeping, scrubbing
        and washing was in the hands of Aunt Dorcas and Drusilla.</p>
        <p>She would make her mother sit down and chat with me, while
        Uncle Jake smoked his cob pipe, but she herself seemed always at
        work.</p>
        <p>“There’s no getting any help nowadays,” said my Uncle. “Even
        if we needed it. Old Joe there stayed on—he was here before I
        was born. Joe must be eighty or over—there’s no telling the age
        of niggers. But the young ones are too uppity for any use. They
        want to be paid out of all reason, and treated like white folks
        at that!”</p>
        <p>He boasted that he had never worn a shirt or a pair of socks
        made off the place. “In my father’s time we raised a heap of
        cotton and sold it. Plenty of niggers then. Now I manage to get
        enough for my own use, and we spin and weave it on the
        spot!”</p>
        <p>I watched Aunt Dorcas at her wheel and loom, and rubbed my
        eyes. It was only in the remote mountain regions that these
        things were done when I was young, and to see it now seemed
        utterly incredible. But Uncle Jake was proud of it.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe there’s another wheel agoin’ in the whole
        country,” he said. “The mountains ain’t what they used to be,
        John. They’ve got the trees all grafted up with new kinds of
        foolishness—nuts and fruit and one thing’n another—and
        unheard-of kinds of houses and schools, and play-acting
        everywhere. I can’t abide it,”</p>
        <p>He set his jaw firmly, making the stiff white beard stand out
        at a sharp angle. “The farm’ll keep us for my time,” he
        concluded; “but I should hate to have it all ‘reformed’ and torn
        to pieces after I’m gone.” And he looked meaningly at me.</p>
        <p>I lingered on, still enjoying the sense of family affection,
        but my satisfaction in the things about me slowly cooling.</p>
        <p>A cotton quilt was heavier but not so warm as a woolen
        blanket. Homespun sheets were durable, doubtless, but not
        comfortable. The bathing to be done in a small steep-sided china
        basin, with water poured from a pitcher the outlines of which
        were more concave than convex, was laborious and
        unsatisfying.</p>
        <p>The relish of that “hog and hominy” and the beaten biscuit,
        the corn pone, the molasses and pork gravy of my youth, wore off
        as the same viands reappeared on the table from day to day and
        week to week, and seemed ceaselessly present within me.</p>
        <p>It was pleasant to listen to Aunt Dorcas’s gentle
        reminiscences of the past years, of my father and mother in
        their youth, of my infancy, and Drusilla’s. She grieved that she
        had not more to tell. “I never was one to visit much,” she
        said.</p>
        <p>But it was saddening to find that the dear old lady could
        talk of absolutely nothing else. In all her sixty-eight years
        she had known nothing else; her father’s home and her husband’s,
        alike in their contents and in their labors, her own domestic
        limitations, and those of her neighbors, and her church
        paper—taken for forty years, and arbitrarily discontinued by
        Uncle Jake because it had grown too liberal.</p>
        <p>“It never seemed over-liberal to me,” she said softly, “and I
        do miss it. I wouldn’t a’believed ’Id a’missed anything so much.
        It used to come every week, and I kept more acquainted with what
        the rest of this circuit was doing. But your Uncle Jake is so
        set against liberalism!”</p>
        <p>I turned to my cousin for some wider exchange of thoughts,
        and strove with all the remembered arts of my youth, and all the
        recently acquired wisdom of my present years, to win her
        confidence.</p>
        <p>It was difficult at first. She was shy with the dumb shyness
        of an animal; not like a wild animal, frankly curious, not like
        a hunted animal, which runs away and hides, but like an animal
        in a menagerie, a sullen, hopeless timidity, due to long
        restriction. Life had slipped by her, all of it, as far as she
        knew. She had been an “old maid” for twenty-five years—they call
        them that in these mountains if they are not married at twenty.
        Her father’s domineering ways had discouraged most of the few
        young men she had known, and he had ruthlessly driven away the
        only one who came near enough to be dismissed.</p>
        <p>Then it was only the housework, and caring for her mother as
        she grew older. The one pleasure of her own she ever had was in
        her flowers. She had transplanted wild ones, had now and then
        been given “a slip” by remote neighbors—in past years; and those
        carefully nurtured blossoms were all that brought color and
        sweetness into her gray life.</p>
        <p>She did not complain. For a long time I could not get her to
        talk to me at all about herself, and when she did it was without
        hope or protest. She had practically no education—only a few
        years in a country school in childhood, and almost no reading,
        writing, conversation, any sort of knowledge of the life of the
        world about her.</p>
        <p>And here she lived, meek, patient, helpless, with neither
        complaint nor desire, endlessly working to make comfortable the
        parents who must some day leave her alone—to what?</p>
        <p>My thirty years in Tibet seemed all at once a holiday
        Compared to this thirty years on an upland farm in the
        Alleghanies of Carolina. My loss of life—what was it to this
        loss? I, at least, had never known it, not until I was found and
        brought back, and she had known it every day and night for
        thirty years. I had come back at fifty-five, regaining a new
        youth in a new world. She apparently had had no youth, and now
        was old—older at forty-five than women of fifty and sixty whom I
        had met and talked with recently.</p>
        <p>I thought of them, those busy, vigorous, eager, active women,
        of whom no one would ever predicate either youth or age; they
        were just women, permanently, as men were men. I thought of
        their wide, free lives, their absorbing work and many minor
        interests, and the big, smooth, beautiful, moving world in which
        they lived, and my heart went out to Drusilla as to a baby in a
        well.</p>
        <p>“Look here, Drusilla,” I said to her at last, “I want you to
        marry me. We’ll go away from here; you shall see something of
        life, my dear—there’s lot of time yet.”</p>
        <p>She raised those quiet blue eyes and looked at me, a long,
        sweet, searching look, and then shook her head with gentle
        finality. “O, no,” she said. “Thank you,’ Cousin John, but I
        could not do that.”</p>
        <p>And then, all at once I felt more lonely and out of life than
        when the first shock met me.</p>
        <p>“O, Drusilla!” I begged; “Do-do! Don’t you see, if you won’t
        have me nobody ever will? I am all alone in the world, Drusilla;
        the world has all gone away from me! You are the only woman
        alive who would understand. Dear cousin—dear little girl—you’ll
        have to marry me—out of pity!” And she did.</p>
        <p>Nobody would know Drusilla now. She grew young at a rate that
        seemed a heavenly miracle. To her the world was like heaven,
        and, being an angel was natural to her anyway.</p>
        <p>I grew to find the world like heaven, too—if only for what it
        did to Drusilla.</p>
